Some climate scientists say the wild weather is just a sample of what we can expect in a warmer world. KQED's Ezra David Romero has this report. Antonio Hueso evacuated his home in the early morning hours of March 12. That's when the Pajaro River levee in Monterey County failed. His two-story home is about an hour south of San Francisco. The cameras on his daisy-yellow-colored house caught the water submerging his street and then his first floor. I check my cameras, 8 o' clock - this is a second river. It's the second time the 72-year-old's home has flooded because this levee failed. He's now considering leaving his home of nearly five decades. I'll fix the house, and when the people forget this, I sell my house, and I move to Madera or Fresno. I don't know. UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain warns what Californians have lived through this winter is only a taste of what's to come as human-caused climate change continues. As disruptive as this year's events have been, we're nowhere near close to a plausible worst case storm and flood scenario for California. Swain is clear about the links between climate change and the increase in extreme flooding. In a study last year, Swain looked at the worst-case scenario - a weekslong parade of extreme atmospheric rivers which California did not have this year. Swain found the warming climate has already doubled the probability of a megaflood. Such catastrophic flooding could create more than $1 trillion in damage. It could happen next year, or it might not happen for 100 years. If this pattern of back-to-back atmospheric rivers sounds familiar, it's because Californians are witnessing an echo of this. Swain says the main differences are that this winter's storms had breaks between them and that none of the storms were considered extreme. We see that it is possible to have years where there are multiple atmospheric rivers in a row that are much stronger than what we saw at any point this year. California is taking Swain's predictions seriously. Michael Anderson is a state climatologist. He's trying to convince the state to fund a project that would model severe flooding scenarios, considering climate data, weather forecasting and local conditions. Anderson says this would give the state a heads-up on just how severe a storm pattern could be, what's at risk of flooding and who should evacuate. Unfortunately, Mother Nature kind of beat us to the punch here. But we're working on trying to develop a capability to kind of help us better understand how to recognize when things are scaling up so that you get the right level of response dialed in. And it's a tool we don't have right now. The project could be completed in a year if the state approves it. The planning is already late for people dealing with flooding from failed levees this winter. The squishy sound is still water being here and mud. Denia Escutia woke up to the sound of water trickling into her room hours after the Pajaro levee broke. My feet touched the rug, and the rug was wet. Escutia is 18 and is questioning whether Pajaro can remain home due to the effects of human-caused climate change.What do you think your future will look like if you stay here? My future - I feel like it will look like gone. Gone because the climate the levee was designed for no longer exists.For NPR News, I'm Ezra David Romero. ",Climate

Sienna Miller plays scientist Rebecca Shearer. Apple TV+ hide caption, The Apple TV+ series Extrapolations tells the story of what's at stake for our planet over the next few decades. Sienna Miller plays scientist Rebecca Shearer., In some ways, Extrapolations is typical eco-thriller fare. The Apple TV+ series depicts a planet on the brink of environmental crisis, where ordinary human beings battle increasingly hostile elements, and a villainous tech tycoon seeks to take over the world., Yet in contrast to apocalyptic climate change dramas, like The Day After Tomorrow and Snowpiercer, Extrapolations doesn't dwell on the End of Days., ""We wanted to focus on what we call the 'messy middle,' "" series creator Scott Burns told NPR in an interview. ""Because before we get to the end, there's a lot of life that we're all gonna have to go through."", Despite the barrage of daily news headlines devoted to climate change, there still aren't many fictional TV shows and movies that deal with the topic. And those that do tend towards disaster, picturing the end of life on Earth as we know it. But Extrapolations attempts to walk the line between fiction and scientific fact to tell the story of what's at stake for our planet over the next few decades., The messy middle dramatized in Extrapolations unfolds over roughly three decades starting about 15 years from now. Burns said he wanted to make climate change feel immediate, especially to young people., If you are 15 or 16 right now and you watch our show, you're gonna be alive in 2070 when our show ends., Scott Burns, 'Extrapolations' creator, ""If you are 15 or 16 right now and you watch our show, you're gonna be alive in 2070 when our show ends,"" Burns said., Burns said much of the show's sense of immediacy about the near future stems from digging into — and making predictions based on — science. His team drew on the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and consulted with climate scientists to come up with storylines., In the episode set in the year 2046, for instance, global temperatures have risen to an alarming 1.8 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Sienna Miller plays a conservationist struggling to save species from going extinct., ""Ocean temp is over 90 most days. Krill is gone. Almost. Food column is collapsing,"" Miller's character, Rebecca Shearer, laments., Burns is no stranger to putting climate data on screen. An Inconvenient Truth, the Oscar-winning 2006 documentary he co-produced, is essentially a giant PowerPoint presentation packed with a bunch of statistics about global warming., Studies demonstrate how An Inconvenient Truth helped bring climate change into the cultural conversation. But after it came out, Burns found himself asking if there were ways he could harness fiction rooted in science to highlight the problem's urgency in a more visceral way., ""I think that climate change is different when it's portrayed on a graph than when it is portrayed in a story with characters who look and feel like the audience,"" the producer said., When deciding what story to tell about the climate change future we could face, Burns said he wasn't interested in depicting worst-case scenarios., ""We felt that if we did that the show would be very vulnerable to criticism, that we were just sensationalizing,"" he said., To experts like University of Colorado Boulder environmental studies professor Max Boykoff, the predictions in Extrapolations seem, for the most part, well-grounded in science., ""The way in which they talked about forest fires and water scarcity and poor air quality and public health challenges are all the kinds of things that we are writing about,"" Boykoff told NPR in an interview., There are some aspects of Extrapolations that do seem a little far-fetched to the scholar, such as the notion that by 2046, humans would be able to talk to animals in English — among them, a humpback whale voiced by Meryl Streep., Nevertheless, Boykoff said he's excited to see a mainstream TV show tackle climate change so credibly., ""Few people pick up and read peer-reviewed literature on a daily basis,"" Boykoff said. ""And so when it comes to climate change, the way in which entertainment media is engaging with it is critically important to helping a global population understand what we're facing."", That's why, Boykoff said, in our era of misinformation, it's crucial for creators to get the science right., But other experts say having a firm foundation in science isn't the most important thing when it comes to telling compelling climate change stories., I'm less concerned with writers getting it wrong and that being damaging, than I am with us continuing to ignore climate change in the worlds of our stories., Anna Jane Joyner, founder and CEO of Good Energy, ""I'm less concerned with writers getting it wrong and that being damaging, than I am with us continuing to ignore [climate change] in the worlds of our stories,"" said Anna Jane Joyner, the founder and CEO of Good Energy, a nonprofit that supports movie and TV production in the climate change space with research and connections to experts. The company did consulting work on Extrapolations. ""Even just talking about climate change in your story is more beneficial than not,"" Joyner said., A recent Good Energy study revealed that between 2016 and 2020, fewer than three percent of scripted television shows and films even mentioned climate change, let alone had storylines related to the topic., Joyner said she wants this to shift, because she understands how persuasive the types of entertainments can be., Even over-the-top offerings like The Day After Tomorrow show how impactful pop culture can be on raising public awareness around climate change, as a 2004 study in Environment journal focusing on audience responses to that movie showed. The study concluded that, ""some commentators had predicted that the film would bring more public attention to the issue of global warming than the publication of most scientific articles, reports, or congressional testimonies, and this prediction appears to have been correct."", Joyner said Good Energy is helping to conduct a similar study around audiences responses to Extrapolations., Audio and digital stories edited by Ciera Crawford and Ravenna Koenig.

That's a piece of legislation that governs things such as food stamps and farm subsidies. This year, some lawmakers are hoping to include measures to curb climate change. This comes as the latest figures from the Department of Agriculture show that about 11% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. comes from - yeah, you guessed it - agriculture. Here's NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Jonathan Godes, the mayor of Glenwood Springs, Colo., has a go-bag at his front door. His wife and two daughters each have one, too. That's because he's had to evacuate three times in 15 years due to wildfires in the region. Any time there's a dry summer, you're sitting on your deck, and you see a little plume of smoke come up, and you go, gosh, is that a cloud? Is that a fire somewhere? How close is it? In 2020, the Grizzly Creek Fire burned 30,000 acres and shut down Interstate 70, a major highway cutting across the state. The next summer, the town was hit again, this time by flooding. Because the fire had burned trees, brush and ground cover, the ground wasn't able to absorb the water, and Interstate 70 was washed out. Godes and his family rode out the storm. It was a huge impact for us locally, for the region. And, really, the country even, when you take out a transportation route like that. And, obviously, we're seeing more and more of those events. Now he's been working with his members of Congress to include funding for disaster recovery in the next Farm Bill. Across the American West, farmers, foresters and mayors are turning to Congress for money to prevent and recover from climate disasters. The Farm Bill has long authorized conservation programs. They help implement different ways of farming to improve soil health and reduce emissions. It also supports the U.S. Forest Service and funding for forest management. This year, lawmakers are considering ways to improve relief programs. Proponents want to increase public awareness about the programs and help farmers apply for them.Historically, the Republican Party has resisted efforts to address climate change, but many GOP members also represent rural areas on the front lines of climate disasters. Cathy Day, climate policy coordinator at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, says more Republicans may now be open to the conversation. It definitely changed in terms of what individual offices are willing to talk about, but there are also some very strong political lines that get drawn around what solutions ought to look like. And so that continues to make it an often complex conversation. Last year, Democrats secured a record $20 billion to expand conservation programs. But some Republicans have proposed repealing those funds and allocating them to programs not related to climate. Other Democrats have their own plans in mind for this year's Farm Bill. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado is pushing to include $60 billion to restore and manage forests. The current situation that we have is completely untenable because we're spending 30 times more to recover from severe wildfires after the burn than we do to prevent wildfires in the first place. He says there's a connection between the health of forests in the West and local economies, and he hopes that agriculture panels continue the conversation. Almost every single farmer and rancher in every single farming and ranching community in the West is downstream from the forests that we're talking about here. I can't think of a more appropriate place to have this discussion. Lawmakers have until September 30 to write the 2023 Farm Bill.Ximena Bustillo, NPR News. ",Politics
https://www.npr.org/2023/04/03/1167815835/farms-could-help-sustain-texas-oyster-industry-amid-climate-change,2023-04-03,Farms could help sustain Texas' oyster industry amid climate change,Katie Watkins,"Texas is one of the last coastal states in the U.S. to allow farm-raised oysters. The state started to develop the program three years ago. Now, farms are in their initial harvest. Houston Public Media's Katie Watkins reports on the sustainability of Texas oysters as they face threats from climate change. If you drive about an hour and a half southeast of Houston, to Bolivar Peninsula, and then take a boat, about a mile off the coast, you'll see black objects bobbing on the waves. They look like a flock of birds, but commenters on Facebook had different ideas, according to Hannah Kaplan. It's an alien landing site... Yeah. ...Or it's CIA doing secret research. Or it's a trap for your boats or something like that. Kaplan is the founder of Barrier Beauties, the second permitted oyster farm in the state. The mysterious items are the mesh bags she uses to grow her oysters. As the oysters grow, we move them from cage to cage so that they have room to grow and filter water. The bags are attached to lines that are anchored to the sea floor on her 10-acre plot. Kaplan, who grew up in Houston, was working at a hotel in Aspen, Colo., when the pandemic hit. Her job shut down, so she started looking at this new Texas industry that sounded exciting. I'm still learning every day. They are live animals, so we can only do so much to control them. The water and weather conditions can't be controlled, but Kaplan says there are some things they can do to shape how the oysters grow. Those include splitting... We just have to split them into different bags to give them room to breathe and grow. ...And tumbling... ...Where the oysters are placed in a rotating tube. And it helps chip off the edges so that they grow with a deeper cup rather than longer. That gives farmed oysters a different look from their wild counterparts. Oysters that are maricultured tend to just be prettier, and so they're more desirable for the half-shell market. That's Lauren Williams with The Nature Conservancy in Texas. I think oyster farming is one tool in the toolbox when it comes to how to create a more sustainable oyster industry in Texas. She says farmed oysters can provide some of the same natural benefits as wild oysters, such as purifying the water. That matters because wild Texas oysters haven't fared well for years. They've suffered from drought, flood events and hurricanes - conditions that are exacerbated by human-caused climate change. We're seeing larger storms, and with those storms comes sedimentation. It's hard for reefs to recover from that sedimentation. And without oyster reefs, coastal communities are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, like sea level rise and hurricane storm surge. Farmed oysters won't replace wild oysters, but they could help relieve some of the harvesting pressure. The majority of wild reefs in Texas are already close to harvesting, even though the oyster season is supposed to stay open through April. It's basically at the whim of nature and rather unpredictable. That's Joe Fox. He's the executive director of Palacios Marine Agriculture Research, located on the central Texas coast. Before that, he helped start the state's oyster farming industry. What commercial oyster farming can do is level that playing field. Fox says that made it pretty easy to get people on board. In 2019, state lawmakers passed legislation that gave Texas Parks and Wildlife the authority to develop the program. In a very short period of time, we've kind of jump-started an industry. Now there are four farms in the state, including Kaplan's, and other applications are in the works. That could mean different-tasting oysters because oysters are a bit like fine wine. Their taste reflects where they're grown, meaning each Texas farm has its own unique flavor.For NPR News, I'm Katie Watkins in Galveston. ",Climate
https://www.npr.org/2023/04/03/1167683143/activist-investors-press-corporations-to-take-action-against-climate-change,2023-04-03,Activist investors press corporations to take action against climate change,"Leila Fadel, Michael Copley","Over the next few months, shareholders in publicly traded companies will be gathering at annual meetings to weigh in on how companies are run. They'll vote on issues like executive pay and who sits on corporate boards. And a big focus again this year is climate change. Michael Copley joins us from NPR's climate desk to explain what's going on. Good morning, Michael. Hey. Good morning, Leila. So these are companies that millions of Americans are invested in through their retirement funds. So which issues are getting a lot of attention at these meetings? Yeah, so every year, investors can submit what are called shareholder resolutions. It's just a way to ask a company to do something, and all the shareholders get to vote. According to one recent tally, shareholders had filed more than 500 resolutions so far this year, asking companies to address environmental, social and corporate governance issues. Out of all those resolutions, almost a quarter focus on climate change. And more climate resolutions have been filed so far this year than at the same point in 2022. So why so many resolutions now? You know, I've heard a couple explanations. One is just that more investors are worried about climate change. Scientists working for the United Nations recently said the Earth's on track for catastrophic warming that'll bring more extreme weather - stuff like hurricanes, floods and droughts - that can cause a lot of economic damage in addition to human suffering. The other thing is U.S. regulators have made it harder for companies to block certain kinds of shareholder resolutions. OK, so what kind of things are investors asking for? You know, I think in general, investors are trying to understand how companies are contributing to climate change and how they're dealing with the problem. So they want companies to make plans for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Investors also want to know how companies are preparing for changes in the economy and new regulation - so shifting to more renewable energy and electric vehicles. I talked to Kirsten Snow Spalding at Ceres. It's a nonprofit that works on sustainability issues. Here's how she described it. In layman's terms, it's set targets. Issue plans. Give us clear disclosure. And all of it is about, how are you addressing the risks and moving forward towards the opportunities? Investors also want to know what companies are doing behind the scenes, lobbying on issues related to climate change. So there's real concern here, and investors are pressing their case. Are we seeing big changes, though, in corporate policies? Companies have made a lot of promises to cut emissions, and I think that's because of shareholder pressure. Investors are talking to these companies all year round, and these annual meetings are a good way for shareholders to sort of apply more pressure. Some proposals never go to a vote because the two sides strike a deal. But what we also know is that while the number of climate proposals is increasing, when it came time to vote at meetings last year, support on average fell. Some say that's because proposals by activist shareholders have just gotten more ambitious. So maybe the resolutions were more aggressive than mainstream investors could stomach. Others say some proposals were too heavy-handed, so there was concern that they might interfere with how companies are managed. While all this negotiation is going on, emissions are going up. So what's the outlook for the votes that are coming up? You know, we've seen some activists have sort of tweaked their strategies. So instead of calling for banks to cut off funding for fossil fuels, they're asking to sort of set windows for phasing out funding to kind of give them more leeway. But I think there's still going to be tension between what scientists say we need to do to meet climate targets and what a lot of companies say is doable. You know, just recently, a big insurance company said it's going to require clients in the oil and gas industry to cut emissions of methane. It's a potent greenhouse gas. A big shareholder group said, great, but it's not enough, and we're going to keep pushing for more aggressive action. NPR's Michael Copley, thanks so much. Thanks, Leila. ",Climate
https://www.npr.org/2023/04/02/1167371279/why-deforestation-means-less-rain-in-tropical-forests,2023-04-02,Why deforestation means less rain in tropical forests,"Lauren Sommer, Seyma Bayram","View of a deforested and burned area of the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil on Sept. 2, 2022. Douglas Magno/AFP/Getty Images hide caption, View of a deforested and burned area of the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil on Sept. 2, 2022., A new study has uncovered that forest loss is changing weather patterns in the world's three largest remaining tropical rainforests., The study, published in the journal Nature last month, found that clearing wide swaths of trees — what's known as deforestation — reduces rainfall in tropical rainforests, which actually generate their own rain. When it rains, trees soak up and use that water. They then release that moisture, both through evaporation and through their leaves. That humid air rises and helps create clouds, which in turn create more rain., This process, called precipitation recycling, accounts for up to 41% of the rainfall in the Amazon and up to 50% in the Congo, according to the study's authors. When trees are cut down, it breaks this cycle, hampering the formation of rain and leading to drought. Reduced precipitation recycling due to forest loss, the researchers say, has grave repercussions for agriculture, hydropower generation and climate resilience — as well as for the rainforest itself., ""Global efforts to restore large areas of degraded and deforested land could enhance precipitation, reversing some of the reductions in precipitation due to forest loss observed here,"" the authors wrote. They called for renewed efforts to protect rainforests and urged world leaders to act on their pledges to stop deforestation., The study looked at satellite data on rainfall and forest loss in the world's largest rainforest, the Amazon, which covers nine countries; the Congo Basin, the second largest rainforest spanning six countries; and Southeast Asia, home to Indonesia's thriving Leuser Ecosystem., Tree stumps scar the forest's floor after 2,100 acres of forests were felled to plant oil palms in the heart of the Congo Basin forest near Kisangani, Democratic Republic of Congo, on Sept. 25, 2019. Samir Tounsi/AFP/Getty Images hide caption, Tree stumps scar the forest's floor after 2,100 acres of forests were felled to plant oil palms in the heart of the Congo Basin forest near Kisangani, Democratic Republic of Congo, on Sept. 25, 2019., Each of these rainforests is losing trees primarily to agricultural land use. The Amazon has lost a significant amount of its forest cover — more than an estimated 60 million acres from 2000 to 2010 alone. Much of the deforestation in the Amazon is due to soy cultivation and cattle farming., In Indonesia, peatland forests are burned to the ground for lucrative palm oil plantations — a cheap oil commonly found in packaged foods, cleaning and cosmetic products and increasingly in biofuels. The palm oil industry, illegal logging and deforestation by small-scale farmers in West-Central Africa are also decimating the rainforests in the Congo Basin., ""When we're removing trees, we're making the environment drier and that lack of moisture that's the big cloud above those trees just disappears,"" said Callum Smith, a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Leeds in England and co-author of the study., In the Congo, deforestation could reduce local rainfall by 8%-10% by the end of the century, the study points out. Scientists are also seeing the impact in the Amazon., ""The important thing to remember is that this is just due to forest loss,"" Smith said of the Congo prediction. ""We're screening out the effect(s) of climate change."", Robin Averbeck, forest program director at the Rainforest Action Network, said global forests are critical for producing rainfall and regulating global temperatures. They also capture carbon dioxide, which is a major contributor to human-caused climate change. That gas releases, though, when trees are cut down or burned., ""Once we deforest, we lose one of our greatest natural defenses in protecting ourselves from climate change. This is not only true for forests, but also other ecosystems,"" Averbeck said. Draining and burning peatlands for palm oil plantations, particularly in Indonesia, also releases carbon into the atmosphere, they said., Rangers cut down illegal palm oil trees within the protected Leuser Ecosystem rainforest in Aceh Province, Indonesia, on Jan. 9, 2019. Chaideer Mahyuddin/AFP/Getty Images hide caption, Rangers cut down illegal palm oil trees within the protected Leuser Ecosystem rainforest in Aceh Province, Indonesia, on Jan. 9, 2019., Averbeck said banks, corporations and governments need to adopt and meaningfully enforce regulations and policies to prevent future deforestation, while not funding or using crops or products cultivated on deforested land. They also said ensuring and protecting Indigenous land rights is a critical step in preventing deforestation and rights abuses before they occur., Indigenous lands contain 80% of the planet's remaining biodiversity, Averbeck pointed out. For this reason, Averbeck said it is critical for Indigenous people to be able to resist development and for governments and companies to respect their decision., In Brazil, deforestation dramatically decreased through law enforcement under Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was president from 2003 to 2010. The country saw deforestation surge and reach a 15-year high in 2021 under former President Jair Bolsonaro. Lula, who assumed the presidency again this year, campaigned on preserving the Amazon and protecting Indigenous communities., A firefighter works to put out a large forest fire in Porto Jofre, Brazil, on Sept. 4, 2021. Carl De Souza/AFP/Getty Images hide caption, A firefighter works to put out a large forest fire in Porto Jofre, Brazil, on Sept. 4, 2021., Unlike Indonesia and the Brazilian Amazon, much of the forest loss in the Congo Basin is due to poor, small-scale farmers trying to survive, explained Frances Seymour, senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, a global nonprofit that works with leaders to solve environmental problems. Addressing deforestation in the Congo Basin is more complex, she said., ""It really requires an across-the-board approach to rural development that provides these communities with access to improved agricultural methods and to clean energy sources and other alternatives to make a decent living and live a decent life that doesn't require the exploitation of forest resources,"" Seymour said., She said it is important to distinguish between corporations and governments that are engaging in illegal actions — such as opening unlicensed palm oil plantations, illegal road construction and logging or corruption — and poorer communities that depend on the rainforest because they lack other resources., ""There's a real moral problem about exercising law enforcement against people who have no alternative, some of the most vulnerable people in the world,"" she said., Bernardo Flores, an economist at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil, said the Amazon region is already being stressed by hotter temperatures. According to a 2018 study, temperatures there have increased by more than 1 degree Fahrenheit over the last 40 years. Flores is worried that the rainforest is heading toward a tipping point., ""You would trigger this domino effect related to the loss of rainfall. Then you would lose a large part of the Amazon,"" he said. ""We wouldn't be able to control that anymore."", The Amazon, home to millions of species, has absorbed a large amount of pollution, as carbon dioxide emissions have soared over the last 50 years. Species like jaguars, seen here in 2021, and harpy eagles are being threatened by deforestation.

Rainforests also need global temperatures to stop rising., ""The Amazon is important for everyone in the world,"" Flores said.

This just a week after tornadoes devastated communities in Mississippi and Alabama. So what's driving these storms? Let's turn now to someone who's been tracking them, Matthew Cappucci. He's a meteorologist at The Washington Post. Good morning. Hey. Good morning. Thanks so much for having me. So two big storm systems, two weekends in a row - like, what is driving all of this? Yeah, definitely. So unfortunately, it's kind of the time of year where we see these things like clockwork across the Deep South, the Midwest and the Plains. Every year, right around March, April, May, June, we start seeing the winter's cold in the upper atmosphere retreat over the lower 48. At the same time, warmth is trying to build from the Gulf of Mexico and push northwards with warmth and moisture. And so you get a seasonal clash of the air masses. That brews strong thunderstorms that can grow really tall in the atmosphere.Now, at the same time, the jet stream, or that river of winds in the upper atmosphere, is still in its wintertime position over the country. And so these storm clouds that grow tall - they start feeling that jet stream, and they start to spin. That causes episode after episode of tornado. And, you know, during April, May, June, the peak of tornado season, we tend to see about 660 tornadoes on average across the lower 48. That said, this year has been above average already. January saw about 120, 130 of them, which is the second or third most on record. In February, we saw 55 of them, which is twice as many as normal, and March will be a busy month, as well. So unfortunately, there really is no end in sight anytime soon. So you're saying that this storm season is worse than usual so far. So is climate change a factor in that? Or what may be making it worse than usual? Yeah. So there are a couple of contributing factors. I don't think climate change is one of them. Like we talked about, you know, it's sort of a typical time of year to see these storm systems. They typically go through with tornadoes. It's an unfortunate thing that every year that we see these, but it is rather predictable. Now, this season might be a little bit worse due to something called a La Nina, which is basically a large, overarching weather pattern that begins with a cooling of water temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific. That essentially changes the position of key weather systems, including the jet stream, which makes severe weather a little bit more likely.Now, La Nina kind of had its final burst, kind of its sort of final episode recently and now is switching to a neutral state and pushing eventually towards the opposite of La Nina, which is an El Nino. There is some research to suggest that during the transition of La Nina to El Nino, we get a flare-up of activity, which may be playing a role. So that could be potentially a contributing factor. That said, climate change does not have a firm link to tornado activity. We note that there isn't any evidence to suggest an uptick in the number or the intensity of tornadoes, but there may be shifts in where and when they occur.For example, we're noticing more in, like, December, January, February, the traditional cool season, because temperatures are becoming a little bit warmer, enough to sustain supercell or rotating thunderstorms at a time of year when we wouldn't ordinarily have as many. We're also noticing a little bit drier weather over the High Plains in parts of April and May, which is reducing the number of tornadoes in what was traditionally once considered Tornado Alley. So shifting patterns but not necessarily shifting numbers. In the 30 seconds we have left, I gather there are reports of more storms coming this week. Most definitely. The Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex could see more tornado activity today, including the risk of a strong tornado. Then Tuesday, another large-scale synoptic outbreak could stretch from areas of Iowa all the way down to parts of the Mississippi Valley towards Tennessee. That's Matthew Cappucci, meteorologist at The Washington Post. Thank you so much for being with us. Thank you. ",Weather

It's being cited by politicians in several countries. Kyle Ellingson for NPR hide caption, The conspiracy theory alleges that a shadowy global elite conspires to control the world's population, in part by forcing them to eat insects. It's being cited by politicians in several countries., In mid-March, a far-right Dutch member of parliament named Thierry Baudet tweeted """" accompanied by a photo of himself holding a microphone in one hand and pouring golden mealworms out of a bag in the other., Earlier in the month, Poland's ruling nationalist party Law and Justice falsely alleged that the opposition Civic Platform was trying to push citizens into eating worms, prompting the opposition to hit back with a similar accusation., Those are just some of several instances of European right-wing politicians lobbing a conspiracy theory that elites want people to eat bugs. The accusations arrived shortly after the European Union approved mealworms and crickets as food ingredients., Across the Atlantic, American right-wing pundits and influencers decry a similar plot. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration permits small amounts of insect matter to be included in foods., ""The ruling class really, really wants us to eat bugs,"" conservative commentator Michael Knowles said in a YouTube video in January of 2022, waving a printout of a Bloomberg opinion piece titled ""Why Bugs Must Be a Bigger Part of the Human Food Chain."" The story he referred to actually focused on insects' potential as high-nutrient animal feed and on insects' ability to process human food waste, rather than as food for human consumption., On March 29, the conservative video outlet Prager University featured man-on-the-street interviews with host Aldo Buttazzoni telling passersby that ""the World Economic Forum wants you to eat bugs to save the planet"" and asking them if they wanted to eat live crickets and bread ostensibly made with cricket flour., Including insects in human food has been an emerging, but still marginal, idea among climate scientists and food security experts. In countries where insects have not been a part of the diet, it's an idea that has long been met with hesitancy and occasional ridicule., In recent years, however, this aversion has fused with an amorphous and shapeshifting conspiracy theory in which a shadowy global elite conspires to control the world's population. For those who espouse the theory, eating bugs isn't just a matter of disgust, or questioning the impacts of climate change. It's framed as a matter of individual freedom and government control., Scientists say it's urgent to cut climate pollution from agriculture — mainly by reducing meat consumption and eating more plant-based food. Using insects as a source of protein is an idea that's floated on the edges of the policy debate. Even though the idea is far from taking off, it captured the public's imagination in the U.S. in the early 2010s when the press covered United Nations reports about edible insects, initially as a way to improve food security., A worker checks on fly larvae being bred in France as a rich source of protein to feed livestock in a 2021 file photo. While the idea hasn't gone mainstream, some see insect feed and edible insects as a way to lower climate pollution in the agricultural sector.

While the idea hasn't gone mainstream, some see insect feed and edible insects as a way to lower climate pollution in the agricultural sector., Earlier online discussions about eating insects were mostly reactions to news stories with responses ranging from curiosity to disgust. Take the phrase ""I will not eat the bugs"" as an example. Some of the earliest instances of the phrase surfaced on the 4chan message board on Aug. 30, 2019. Anonymous users repeated the phrase in response to a photo of climate activist Greta Thunberg, sometimes paired with the phrase ""I will not live in a pod,"" said Sara Aniano, a disinformation researcher at the Anti-Defamation League, who identified the 4chan posts for NPR., ""It kind of started out and continues to be kind of a meme,"" said Aniano. ""So some people might be using it earnestly and some people might be using it ironically."", The paired phrase ""I will not eat the bugs and I will not live in a pod"" traveled to Twitter on Sept. 23 when someone who self-identified as a ""Proud Nationalist"" commented on a photo showing a co-living space lined with bunk beds. It did not receive much engagement., The next day, a Twitter account with just over 300 followers tweeted out the phrase in all caps paired with an anime-style image of a young woman screaming. The tweet was liked more than 500 times within a day, and the phrase spread., ""I really didn't expect it to become a meme; there wasn't much thought behind it,"" the owner of the account told NPR. ""I was just making fun of people getting upset about articles around that time and it became a rallying cry."", On Sept. 26, investor, venture capitalist and cryptocurrency promoter Nic Carter picked up the phrase and followed up with an image titled ""climate solutions."" It showed a car screeching toward a side road under a sign ""eat the bugs,"" with ""more nuclear power"" being the main road. He had more than 35,000 followers at the time., Researchers at Social Media Research Foundation searched for tweets and website links going back to 2018. NPR also reviewed discussions in 2019 and before on Google, Facebook and smaller social platforms like Rumble, Kiwifarms and Bitchute via Junkipedia and Pyrra Technologies., The phrase ""I will not eat the bugs"" would later resurface as part of a COVID-era conspiracy theory about government coercion, but it's difficult to pin down when it began. As COVID-19 swept across the world in early 2020 and governments imposed mandates on masks and upheld restrictions on social gatherings and travel, the conspiracy theory that global elites were seizing an opportunity — or even inventing an excuse — to exert more control over an unknowing population flourished, including by forcing them to eat insects., But the pandemic wasn't the start. As ""I will not eat the bugs"" proliferated on Twitter in September 2019, a science fiction writer published a short story titled ""Live in the Pod and Eat Bugs,'' set in a dystopian world where the characters had no choice but to eat insects., A few months earlier, in April 2019, a few days after a fire destroyed part of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, a blogger who self-identifies as a ""white identitarian"" suggested that eating insects is a ""symbol of our enslavement."", ""There's an undefined 'they' in charge,"" says Ciaran O'Connor, a senior analyst at the nonprofit Institute for Strategic Dialogue, reviewing the post for NPR. ""'We would have almost no luxuries and would work for whatever minor consumption we would be allowed' ... I definitely see New World Order overtones."", ""In this iteration, they are going to make you eat bugs,"" he observes., The New World Order that O'Connor refers to is a decades-old conspiracy theory describing a world shadow government, often involving Jewish people. The name is based on a book published in the 1990s by conservative Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson., It mostly stayed on the fringe of public consciousness until early 2020, when many people questioned the stay-at-home measures put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19. It got an extra boost during the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in July 2020, when chairman Klaus Schwab announced an initiative called ""the Great Reset."", Participants walk in the street of the Alpine resort of Davos during the World Economic Forum annual meeting on Jan. 18.

The gathering of the world's elites in Davos has become a focal point for many conspiracy theories., Vague and sprawling, the Great Reset urged a rethinking of national and global systems of government in the wake of COVID-19. The gathering of global elites in Davos has long held the imagination of conspiracy theorists and the initiative quickly became construed as evidence that global elites were using the outbreak to further enslave the masses., ""The Great Reset is just the New World Order repackaged,"" says O'Connor., Within months, the Great Reset entered the right-wing vernacular with figures such as Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Ben Shapiro and Glenn Beck all echoing the idea, according to a report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue that O'Connor co-authored., During the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in 2022, conservative pundit Noor Bin Ladin further brought up insect eating as part of the Great Reset during an appearance on former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's show., ""I don't want to eat the bugs. I don't want to live in the pod. I don't want to be trapped in a digital jail, and nothing they can do will make me,"" she said. Memes with similar wording have been circulating on social media., One of the major differences between the older New World Order conspiracy theories and the Great Reset is their prominence, says O'Connor., ""[The Great Reset] has been adapted and adopted by leading prominent political figures in many, many countries in a way that's new,"" says O'Connor. ""This was very immediately 'the Great Reset is a left-wing thing and our response were we're pro-freedom [and it] is a right-wing thing.'"", Right-wing figures can demonize their opponents by tying these conspiracies to them, says the ADL's Aniano. She notes that those who have supported eating insects only suggest doing so on a voluntary basis., The Great Reset has become a catchall, absorbing opposition to many different kinds of climate initiatives. In the United Kingdom, protesters flocked to Oxford from across the country in February to protest policy proposals that would reduce traffic and increase walkability, many citing the conspiracy theory and claiming that the government wanted to turn cities into ""open air prisons."", Eating insects is ""alien to our normal way of life, all of this is anti-human, anti life on this planet,"" said conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on his Infowars show., ""Eating insects is repulsive and un-American,"" said Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2019., Cambodian vendors carry fried tarantulas and crickets in the town of Skun in Kampong Cham province on Jan. 15.

Mexicans put grasshoppers in their tacos; the Japanese cook them in soy sauce. Insects such as silkworms are part of the diet for many living in Southeast Asia and China., The ancient Greeks and Romans ate insects. Aristotle wrote of cicadas: ""At first, the males are the sweeter eating; but, after copulation, the females, as they are full then of white eggs."" Pliny the Elder documented that the Roman epicures of his day enjoyed moth grubs fattened on flour and wine., Insect colonies in modern day Western Europe declined in the 13th century during what climate scientists call ""the Little Ice Age,"" which may have put an end to that tradition of eating insects in the region, says Julie Lesnik, an associate professor of biological anthropology at Wayne State University in Detroit., When Europeans first sailed to what is now the Americas, they encountered Indigenous people who included insects in their diet and reacted with revulsion. Diego Álvarez Chanca, who sailed with Christopher Columbus on his second voyage, wrote in a letter: ""They eat all the snakes, and lizards, and spiders, and worms, that they find upon the ground; so that, to my fancy, their bestiality is greater than that of any beast upon the face of the Earth."", ""There was very much an idea that you are what you eat back then. And so the Europeans felt they needed European foods,"" says Lesnik. ""There is very much a worry that if you ate the Indigenous foods, you would become a savage."", Conservative media influencers continue to tap into this sentiment today. ""I don't want to live like a peasant in the middle of the jungle in Vietnam. I want to live like a civilized person with a cultural inheritance,"" said Knowles in response to the Bloomberg article. ""I'm not going to eat the bugs."", Lesnik sees a throughline between the early colonizers and the conservative outrage today., ""The easiest punching bag ... is to pick on something that looks uncivilized.""",Economy

The two new laws represent the largest investment in the agency's history., Sean O'Donnell, the EPA inspector general, testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee that the share of money tied to the latter piece of legislation — $41 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed just with Democratic votes — did not come with sufficient oversight funding. That, he said, has left his team of investigators ""unable to do any meaningful IRA oversight."", The EPA has used its Biden-era windfall to launch or expand a huge range of programs, including clean drinking water initiatives, electric school bus investments and the creation of a new Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights., O'Donnell testified that the new office could be at particular risk for misspent funds. He noted that the programs and initiatives which were consolidated into the environmental justice office previously had a cumulative budget of $12 million, a number that has now ballooned more than 250-fold into a $3 billion grant portfolio., ""We have seen this before: the equation of an unprepared agency dispensing an unprecedented amount of money times a large number of struggling recipients equals a high risk of fraud, waste and abuse,"" O'Donnell told lawmakers., The inspector general testified that while both the EPA and lawmakers have been supportive of his office's oversight goals, his budget hasn't kept pace with the scale of the agency's work after more than a decade of ""stagnant or declining"" funding from Congress., Broader budget constraints, according to his testimony, have forced the department to ""cancel or postpone work in important EPA areas, such as chemical safety and pollution cleanup"" as it tries to meet increased demands tied to oversight of environmental disaster responses — like the East Palestine train derailment — and allegations of whistleblower reprisal., In a statement, EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll told NPR that the agency appreciates the inspector general's analysis and noted that the EPA has requested new appropriations through the president's budget proposal in order to expand its oversight and fraud prevention work.",Politics

Now homeowners can get new credits for heat pumps from federal climate legislation. Julia Simon/NPR hide caption, James Tucker got an efficient heat pump for his home near Oakland, Calif., last year. Now homeowners can get new credits for heat pumps from federal climate legislation., Sales of super-efficient electric heat pumps are rising, now overtaking sales of gas furnaces in the U.S. But what are heat pumps? And why do some call them a key climate solution? Here are the answers to your most burning heat pump questions., The name ""heat pump"" is a bit of a misnomer, says Kevin Kircher, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University who works with the Center for High Performance Buildings., ""A lot of people dislike the name 'heat pump', right? 'Cause it doesn't really convey, you know, the full range of what the machine can do,"" he says., Heat pumps can work for both heating and cooling. Kircher says you can think of a heat pump as an air conditioner that can also work backwards. The highly efficient machines use electricity and refrigerants to cool air on hot days., In the winter, even if the outdoor air is cold, it's still normally warmer than the refrigerant inside the heat pump, Kircher says. So the refrigerant can absorb bits of heat from the outdoor air and bring it inside to warm your home., The fact that heat pumps use electricity is a big reason why governments around the world see them as a key climate solution, says Yannick Monschauer, energy analyst at the International Energy Agency in Paris. That's because heat pumps can replace gas furnaces, and the electricity they run on is increasingly powered by renewables, Monschauer says. Reducing gas usage in homes also reduces leaks of methane, a potent planet-heating gas., Fossil fuel-based heating still accounted for 45% of global heating equipment sales in 2021. But if governments like the US and the European Union meet the targets laid out in climate legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act and REPowerEU, heat pumps could significantly slash planet-heating fossil fuel use in buildings, Monschauer says., ""We see that heat pumps could bring down global CO2 emissions by half a gigaton by the end of this decade,"" he says. ""So that is comparable to the annual emissions of Canada."", James Tucker with his heat pump that replaced his old gas furnace. Julia Simon/NPR hide caption, James Tucker with his heat pump that replaced his old gas furnace., Last year's federal climate legislation offers new economic incentives for homeowners to install heat pumps, says Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a research organization working on saving energy. An IRS spokesperson tells NPR that the new credits can translate to up to $2000 for efficient heat pumps bought after January 1, 2023. If you buy a new heat pump, Nadel says to keep your receipts for reference for next year's tax season. If you bought a heat pump in 2022 you can get credit for this upcoming tax season, but the previous incentive was smaller, up to $500, the IRS says., Some states and some utilities also give rebates for efficient heat pumps. Nadel says you should check with your utility to see if there are programs available in your area., As for renters, it's also possible to get credits for appliances like efficient heat pumps according to the IRS., Earlier generations of heat pumps didn't work as efficiently in freezing temperatures, but Monschauer says there's been great improvements in technology., ""In the coldest parts of Europe we also have the highest shares of heat pumps. So in Norway, for example, 60% of the households are equipped with heat pumps. And in Sweden and Finland it is also 40%. So it's definitely proven that it's possible."", The heat pump systems commonly found in Scandinavian homes do not need to run on backup fossil fuels, Monschauer says., Not all heat pumps sold in the U.S. work well in the coldest weather. It's important that you consult with an installer who is familiar with heat pumps, and make sure to find a machine that's most efficient for your weather, Nadel says., ""In a cold climate that gets below 20 degrees Fahrenheit fairly often, you should look into getting into an Energy Star cold climate certified heat pump,"" Nadel says, referring to a U.S. government program that makes markers for efficiency., Heat pumps can work for both heating and cooling. You can think of a heat pump as an air conditioner that can also work backwards. Julia Simon/NPR hide caption, Heat pumps can work for both heating and cooling. You can think of a heat pump as an air conditioner that can also work backwards., Because heat pumps move heat around instead of burning fossil fuels for heat, they are more efficient than gas furnaces. And while heat pumps are typically more expensive on the front end, the savings come over time when you end up spending less on gas, says Brian Rees, a heat pump installer at Bryant Air Conditioning & Heating Company in Lincoln, Nebraska., Rees says the cost savings are what attract his customers to heat pumps, ""It's more about hitting their pocketbook,"" he says. ""It's more about what's going to save them money in the long run, and heat pumps will do that."", Kircher says you can also save money if you can buy a heat pump for both your heating and cooling needs. ""It's typically cheaper than buying a gas furnace plus an air conditioner,"" he says., Like refrigerators or air conditioners, heat pumps use refrigerants. The primary refrigerants commonly used in heat pumps are called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, says Duncan Callaway, associate professor of Energy and Resources at UC Berkeley. These HFCs have high global warming potential if they're released into the atmosphere, Callaway says., That's why it's critical that heat pump installers make sure that those refrigerants don't leak and are disposed of properly, he says., ""We need well-trained technicians that sort of understand the importance of collecting that refrigerant and not letting it emit into the atmosphere,"" Callaway says., Kircher also notes that researchers are currently working on developing refrigerant substitutes for HFCs that can drastically reduce climate impacts.",Climate

President Joe Biden's administration cleared the way for California's plan to phase out a wide range of diesel-powered trucks, a part of the state's efforts to drastically cut planet-warming emissions and improve air quality in heavy-traffic areas., SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The Biden administration cleared the way Friday for California's plan to phase out a wide range of diesel-powered trucks, part of the state's efforts to drastically cut planet-warming emissions and improve air quality in heavy-traffic areas like ports along the coast., The decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allows California — which has some of the nation's worst air pollution — to require truck manufacturers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission trucks over the next couple of decades. The rule applies to a wide range of trucks including box trucks, semitrailers and even large passenger pick-ups., ""Under the Clean Air Act, California has longstanding authority to address pollution from cars and trucks. Today's announcement allows the state to take additional steps in reducing their transportation emissions through these new regulatory actions,"" said EPA Administrator Michael Regan, in a statement., Gov. Gavin Newsom applauded the state's role as a leader for setting ambitious vehicle emission standards., ""We're leading the charge to get dirty trucks and buses – the most polluting vehicles – off our streets, and other states and countries are lining up to follow our lead,"" the Democrat said in a statement., The EPA typically sets standards for tailpipe emissions from passenger cars, trucks and other vehicles, but California has historically been granted waivers to impose its own, stricter standards. Other states can then follow suit, and eight other states plan to adopt California's truck standards, Newsom's office said. In a letter last year, attorneys general from 15 states, Washington, D.C., and New York City urged the EPA to approve the California truck standards., The transportation sector accounts for nearly 40% of California's greenhouse gas emissions. Newsom has already moved to ban the sale of new cars that run entirely on gasoline by 2035. The EPA has not acted on those rules., The new truck standards are aimed at companies that make trucks and those that own large quantities of them. Companies owning 50 or more trucks will have to report information to the state about how they use these trucks to ship goods and provide shuttle services. Manufacturers will have to sell a higher percentage of zero-emission vehicles starting in 2024. Depending on the class of truck, zero-emission ones will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035., California has a long legacy of adopting stricter tailpipe emission standards, even before the federal Clean Air Act was signed into law, said Paul Cort, a lawyer with environmental nonprofit Earthjustice., ""We have a vehicle problem,"" Cort said. ""We're addicted to our cars and trucks, and that's a big cause of the air pollution that we're fighting."", But Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, said it's too soon to adopt the California standards., ""The charging infrastructure is certainly not there,"" he said about powering stations for electric vehicles. ""And on top of the charging infrastructure, we have the grid issues."", While California was hit this winter by atmospheric rivers that soaked much of the state, it has for years suffered from drought conditions, and in September, a brutal heat wave that put its electricity grid to the test., The announcement came as advocates are pushing for more ambitious tailpipe emissions standards in other states and at the national level., ""We don't just fight for California, we fight for all of the communities,"" said Jan Victor Andasan, an activist with East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice. The group advocates for better air quality in and around Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city that is known for its dense traffic and intense smog., Andasan and other environmental activists from across the country who are a part of the Moving Forward Network, a 50-member group based at Occidental College in Los Angeles, met with EPA officials recently to discuss national regulations to limit emissions from trucks and other vehicles., But some in the trucking industry are concerned about how costly and burdensome the transition will be for truck drivers and companies., ""The state and federal regulators collaborating on this unrealistic patchwork of regulations have no grasp on the real costs of designing, building, manufacturing and operating the trucks that deliver their groceries, clothes and goods,"" said Chris Spear, president of the American Trucking Association, in a statement., ""They will certainly feel the pain when these fanciful projections lead to catastrophic disruptions well beyond California's borders,"" he added., Federal pollution standards for heavy trucks are also getting tougher. The EPA released rules that will cut nitrogen oxide pollution, which contributes to the formation of smog, by more than 80% in 2027. The agency will propose greenhouse gas emissions limits this year., The agency expects the new standards and government investment will lead to zero-emissions electric and hydrogen fuel cell trucks carrying most of the nation's freight., California activists Andasan and Brenda Huerta Soto, an organizer with the People's Collective for Environmental Justice, are troubled by the impact of pollution from trucks and other vehicles on communities with a large population of residents of color that live near busy ports in Los Angeles, Oakland and other cities as well as warehouse-dense inland areas., Huerta Soto works in Southern California's Inland Empire, where a high concentration of trucks pass through to transport goods. On top of truck pollution, the many cars, trucks and trains that travel through the area burden residents with noises, odors and pollutants these vehicles emit, she said., ""We have the technology, and we have the money"" to move toward zero-emission vehicles, she said.",Environment

Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption, Bats congregate in the Bat Cave in Queen Elizabeth National Park on August 24, 2018. Scientists placed GPS devices on some of the bats to determine flight patterns and how they transmit Marburg virus to humans. Approximately 50,000 bats dwell in the cave., A second country in Africa has recently reported cases of Marburg, an infectious disease that has high fatality rates and, according to the World Health Organization, epidemic potential. The news has lent urgency to ongoing efforts to develop a vaccine for Marburg — and concern among public health officials that earth's changing climate could be fueling the outbreaks., The first outbreak this year was reported in February in Equatorial Guinea, but WHO was concerned the country was undercounting those cases. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Equatorial Guinea had confirmed a total of 13 cases since the beginning of the pandemic. The case count update came the same day as WHO, whose staff on the ground suspected more cases, asked Equatorial Guinea to be transparent about how many cases the country had. Equatorial Guinea has also reported 20 probable cases, all of whom have died., About 1800 miles away, across the continent, Tanzania is also reporting a Marburg outbreak and has confirmed eight cases, including five deaths in the northwest Kagera region, according to WHO., Marburg is a hemorrhagic fever virus, which can lead to the body's organs shutting down. Symptoms vary but usually start with a headache and fever. The host animal is believed to be the fruit bat, which often is found in caves. Bats can directly infect humans or monkeys and pigs can be infected by the bats and then those animals infect humans. Marburg is spread through direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people and through any materials such as bed sheets that become contaminated with the infected fluids., As is the case with Ebola, burial ceremonies have sometimes been a source of infection if people come in contact with secretions of someone who died of the virus., Diagnosis is hard, says Dr. David Freedman, professor emeritus of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, because many poor countries just don't have labs to test disease samples. In fact, while the health officer in Equatorial Guinea suspected Marburg on February 7, the viral sample had to be sent to Senegal, 2,000 miles away, and was only confirmed a week later., The outbreak in two parts of Africa could mean climate change is playing a role. ""A current concern,"" says Dr. Lee Hampton, an epidemiologist with GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, ""is that climate change causing new [higher] average temperatures could result in host animals for the Marburg (and other) viruses moving to areas of the world they have not been before and creating outbreaks where they have not been before."", WHO's Director General General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke about the effects of climate change on disease at a press conference this week. ""The outbreaks of Marburg virus disease are another reminder that we can only truly protect human health if we also protect the health of animals and our planet, which sustains all life,"" said Dr. Tedros, adding that WHO has been working on the issue with the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organisation for Animal Health and the UN Environment Programme. The groups participated in a meeting at WHO headquarters last week and called for countries to ""[strengthen] the policies, strategies, plans, evidence, investment and workforce needed to properly address the threats that arise from our relationship with animals and the environment."", The two outbreaks have intensified efforts to develop better treatments and a possible vaccine., Immediately after the outbreak in Equatorial Guinea began, the WHO convened a meeting of experts to discuss possible vaccines and treatments for the virus. On Wednesday the WHO Director General announced the agency ""is working to begin trials of vaccines and therapeutics as soon as possible."" Dr. Michael Ryan, Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, tells NPR that the next step is to convene a working group to develop the legal framework for the clinical trials., Gavi's Hampton says working quickly to develop a vaccine is critical because every outbreak is a chance for the virus to spread out of control. ""If the virus spreads to larger cities, many more people can be affected, and the virus is that much harder to contain. Worldwide spread becomes a distinct possibility. That's why an effective vaccine that can be deployed at the first sign of an outbreak is needed."", Other measures can be helpful moving forward. More consistent and comprehensive monitoring could help contain future outbreaks, says Tedros., The approach for outbreaks such as Marburg would involve coordinating scientists to routinely monitor of the virus in populations of fruit bats, bat feces and aerosols, and human populations including hospital data, bushmeat diet, and mobility of humans and animals., Oladele A. Ogunseitan, Ph.D., a professor of Population Health and Disease Prevention at the University of California, Irvine who is involved with the WHO effort. ""We currently do not have a single platform where these data are integrated, and we don't necessarily have to do this one virus at a time."", Ogunseitan says this multi-pronged approach has been used successfully with COVID-19 with the monitoring of the virus in urban wastewater, rats and deer populations to predict trends, though he adds that ""the coordination has been sporadic and not as effective as it would have been if we planned it from the get go, particularly in the early stages in Wuhan Market in China."", Marburg was first identified in 1967 among lab workers in Marburg, Germany, and Belgrade, in what is now Serbia. They were exposed to the virus during research with monkeys or tissue samples of the monkeys originally from Uganda., It is ""similar to many other illnesses which is why Marburg can spread before it's identified and before infected people are isolated,"" says Dr. Daniel Bausch, a former U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention medical officer now with the non-profit FIND, which develops diagnostic tests around the world. In fact, news reports say that the first case in the Equatorial Guinea outbreak may have emerged in early January of this year but only prompted alarm in early February, when a health worker saw patients who had severe symptoms associated with Marburg, including bloody diarrhea and blood in vomit., Another reason that it's hard to diagnose early on: People can be infected and not show symptoms of Marburg for two to 21 days, followed by fever, chills, headache and body aches. A rash can appear around day five on a person's body, and additional symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea can occur in the course of the disease. The symptoms can become increasingly severe including jaundice, an inflamed pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, massive internal bleeding, shock and multi-organ failure. The fatality rate varies widely, but the WHO puts it around 50%., Ogunseitan finds it encouraging that with such a high potential fatality rate from Marburg virus, public health experts have several tactics to use to try to prevent outbreaks. ""These activities aim to ensure that we prepare countries to develop workforce capable of interpreting a broad range of information on early warning systems, and to collaborate to prevent outbreaks from becoming pandemics."", Fran Kritz is a health policy reporter based in Washington, D.C., and a regular contributor to NPR.

Barber, Liz Metzger, Rebecca Ramirez","There are no lasting photos of Eunice Foote. Her experiments set the foundation for climate science. Carlyn Iverson/NOAA Climate.gov hide caption, There are no lasting photos of Eunice Foote. Her experiments set the foundation for climate science., Today, most climate science is done with satellites, sensors and complicated computer models. But it all started with two glass tubes., ""A woman, about 170 years ago, used a very simple experimental setup – two glass tubes, two thermometers, an air pump – and was able to demonstrate that if you add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, you warm it up. It's basic physics,"" says Annarita Mariotti, a climate scientist and program director of Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration., Eunice Foote, the woman behind that glass tube experiment, has largely been left out of the history books. Until about 10 years ago, John Tyndall was seen as the grandfather of climate science for setting the foundation for the understanding of the greenhouse gas effect. But Foote's experiment, done three years prior, showed that air with more ""carbonic acid,"" or carbon dioxide, both heated up faster and cooled down slower than regular air., ""She actually did some really important work before John Tyndall even got going. So why was there this grandmother of climate science that had essentially been written out of the history books?"" asks Katharine Wilkinson, a climate scientist and the executive director of The All We Can Save Project. ""Some of the frustration is that her story is still all too relevant today, that there are still far too many women doing really important work that either flies under the radar or gets shoved under the radar."", Foote's study was relatively straightforward. In a series of experiments, she took two glass containers full of air and would pump different gasses – including carbon dioxide and water vapor – into one of the containers. She would then leave those containers in the sun and monitor how quickly they heated up and cooled down in the shade., Her work was presented in 1856, at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It was the first work done by a woman to be presented at the conference – though she did not give the presentation herself. Rather, it was done by physicist and first secretary of the Smithsonian, Joseph Henry., But Foote didn't just pioneer the field of climate science. Mariotti says, ""She opened doors for women in science and in general broader representation in sciences ... She did not have a Ph.D. and she did not have sophisticated experimental set up. And still she did it."", Foote was a pioneer in more ways than one. She was the first woman in the United States to publish papers on physics; she also advocated for women's rights outside of academia. Foote helped organize the Seneca Falls Convention, which launched the women's suffrage movement in the U.S. ""There was something sort of intersectional, perhaps, in her thinking in her life,"" Wilkinson says. ""If we are not bringing critical lenses to understand the root causes of the climate crisis, if we're not bringing critical lenses to understanding the need to embed equality and justice in the solutions to the climate crisis, we're not going to get to a good outcome ...

When might it end?,Nathan Rott,"Another major storm has many in waterlogged, weary California asking, when will this weather end? The state has been walloped by an endless run of storms this winter and spring. NPR's Nathan Rott reports on what's ahead. Let's not bury the lede. Here's weather wizard Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. It's been a hell of a year in California weather, and it isn't over yet. There's still more to come. After years of drought drained reservoirs, and in some cases mandated water cutbacks, California is now awash in snow and rain, like this deluge from just last night. In the state Central Valley, one of the largest agricultural areas in the country, a long-drained lake has come back to life, flooding towns and farms. Two tornadoes recently touched down in Southern California. And in the Sierra Nevada mountains, particularly in the southern part of the range, a historic snowpack has officials worried about snowmelt and more flooding to come. And again, we're still accumulating more snow than we're melting. So the amount of water that's stored up there to melt later is ever-increasing. Earlier this week, California Governor Gavin Newsom and the state's congressional delegation urged the Biden administration to grant the state a major disaster declaration for the flooding. Scores of communities have already been impacted by this year's storms. And in some areas, especially around the San Joaquin River, flooding is expected to continue for months, even though California's rainy season typically tapers off in April. Julie Kalansky, a deputy director with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, says what the state is experiencing is something called weather whiplash. Going back-and-forth between extreme dry and extremely wet. A phenomena that's not new to the state. California, of anywhere in the U.S., has the most variable year to year. And that high variability is only projected to become more variable in the future with climate change. Scientists have linked the long-term megadrought in the West to human-caused climate change. And we do know that climate change means more intense storms. But it's too soon to say what role it's played in this year's deluges. Regardless, Kalansky says, it's clear that these types of massive swings and precipitation are going to continue, making it all the more important, she says, for officials and residents in the state to prepare.

Gabriel Bouys/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, Electric cars charge at a hub in downtown Milan on March 23. Starting in 2035, all cars sold in the European Union will be zero-emission vehicles., European Union member states gave final approval Tuesday to a plan that would require all new cars sold in the EU to be zero-emission vehicles starting in the year 2035., It's part of the EU's plan to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and more ambitious than similar efforts in the U.S. A quarter of the bloc's emissions come from the transportation sector, and 70% of that is road traffic., ""The direction of travel is clear: in 2035, new cars and vans must have zero emissions,"" European Commission Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans said in a statement., ""The new rules on CO2-emissions from cars and vans are a key part of the European Green Deal and will be a big contribution to our target of being climate neutral by 2050,"" Timmermans added., The plan also requires that, by the year 2030, the average emissions of new cars drop by 55% and the average emissions of new vans drop by 50%, compared with vehicle emissions in 2021., There's one major caveat to the plan. The European Commission said it would carve out an exemption for the continued sale of cars that run on e-fuels past 2035 at Germany's request, according to Reuters. E-fuels are made using captured CO2 emissions., Poland opposed the new law, the BBC reported, and Italy, Bulgaria and Romania abstained from the vote., President Biden has said he supports the proliferation of electric vehicles, and in 2021 he signed an executive order setting a goal that half of all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the U.S. in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles, including plug-in hybrids., Several states have announced future bans on gas-powered cars, though., California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington have all said they would prohibit the sale of new gas-powered vehicles beginning in 2035, Money reported., The shift from combustion engines to electric vehicles won't be as easy as turning a key, experts say., Some of the challenges of switching to zero-emission vehicles include the persistently high cost of electric cars, China's dominance of the electric battery supply chain, and a lack of charging infrastructure.",Technology

Farmers have welcomed the water and also sometimes struggled with the deluge. Reporter Amy Mayer has this look at what it all means for spring salads. Andrew Regalado and his father trudge through sticky mud on the edge of a field at World's Finest Farm in Hollister, Calif. They've owned the organic vegetable and herb farm for about 17 years. In a creek bed just beyond the field, cloudy brown water leaps at the banks, and that's days after floodwaters have mostly receded. Another storm is coming. If this water's still here, there's a good chance we might get flooded again. Yeah, so it'll be a tough year. Normally, World's Finest has different crops to harvest throughout the year, but Regalado says this winter, they weren't able to plant anything to pick in March, April or May - no lettuce, parsley or cilantro. The Salinas Valley stretches west and south from here. It's often dubbed the salad bowl of the country, supplying more than 60% of the country's lettuce, usually from early spring to late fall. Occasionally, vegetables from the valley, tainted by bacteria and then eaten raw, have caused foodborne illness. So leafy green growers here take extra precautions. University of California Extension water specialist Michael Cahn says after fields are flooded by breached levees, stopped up storm sewers or nearby creeks, farmers wait, not just for the ground to dry out but to be certain the soil isn't contaminated. The delay that we do for food safety of, you know, 45, 60 days potentially before they would start planting. That could mean hiccups in production of romaine, leaf or butter lettuce this spring. I would expect there's going to be some holes in the supply chain, and the consumer is going to see higher prices eventually. But Grower-Shipper Association President Christopher Valadez estimates about 10% of the region's 200,000 agricultural acres flooded. The rest just got a lot of rain. So there are crops that have been planted that are growing, that are maturing, that will be harvested. For the farm owners, workers and communities affected by flooded fields, the impacts are far greater. Valadez says some places flooded in January and again in March. For them, it's really a double whammy. In places, he says, the swollen Salinas River clogged with debris. The water needed a place to go, but he's hopeful as it recedes, the community can come together to find better water management strategies. And we have to assess, you know, is there anything else we could have done, we could have done better? To balance the nutrients that flooding historically has contributed to the region's fertile soil with the reality of a dense population. A cold, wet winter could have at least one benefit. In recent dry years, an insect has brought a virus that decimated lettuce. Jennifer Clarke heads the Leafy Greens Research Board. Flooding is a challenge, and all this rain is a challenge. And then on the flip side, it might really help us with insect pressure. She's watching to see whether the rains drowned out that virus-toting bug. Late on a clear day, Femilon Regalado and his employees pull black mesh over tiny squash plants to protect them from frost. When the rain finally stops, the soil will need to be tested before they can plant lettuce or spinach. (Speaking Spanish). Always stay positive, he says. Keep moving forward. (Speaking Spanish).

A new study says warming will fuel more supercells or tornados in the United States and that those storms will move eastward from their current range. Victor Gensini/AP hide caption, This May 21, 2020, photo provided by Victor Gensini shows a tornado in Moscow, Kan. A new study says warming will fuel more supercells or tornados in the United States and that those storms will move eastward from their current range., America will probably get more killer tornado- and hail-spawning supercells as the world warms, according to a new study that also warns the lethal storms will edge eastward to strike more frequently in the more populous Southern states, like Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee., The supercell storm that devastated Rolling Fork, Mississippi is a single event that can't be connected to climate change. But it fits that projected and more dangerous pattern, including more nighttime strikes in a southern region with more people, poverty and vulnerable housing than where storms hit last century. And the season will start a month earlier than it used to., The study in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society predicts a nationwide 6.6% increase in supercells and a 25.8% jump in the area and time the strongest supercells twist and tear over land under a scenario of moderate levels of future warming by the end of the century. But in certain areas in the South the increase is much higher. That includes Rolling Fork, where study authors project an increase of one supercell a year by the year 2100., Supercells are nature's ultimate storms, so-called ""Finger of God"" whoppers that are ""the dominant producers of significant tornadoes and hail,"" said lead author Walker Ashley, a professor of meteorology and disaster geography at Northern Illinois University. Tall, anvil-shaped and sky-filling, supercells have a rotating powerful updraft of wind and can last for hours., Supercells spawned the 2013 Moore, Oklahoma, tornado that killed 51 people, the 2011 Joplin, Missouri, tornado outbreak that killed 161 people and the 2011 super outbreak that killed more than 320 people in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, the Mid-South., The study used computer simulations to predict what will happen by the end of the century with different levels of global carbon pollution levels. But Ashley said that stormier future seems like it's already here., ""The data that I've seen has persuaded me that we are in this experiment and living it right now,"" Ashley said in an interview three days before the EF-4 tornado killed more than 20 people in Mississippi on Friday. ""What we're seeing in the longer term is actually occurring right now."", Ashley and others said although the Mississippi tornado fits the projected pattern, it was a single weather event, which is different than climate projections over many years and a large area., Debris is strewn around tornado damaged homes, Sunday, March 26, 2023, in Rolling Fork, Miss. Julio Cortez/AP hide caption, Debris is strewn around tornado damaged homes, Sunday, March 26, 2023, in Rolling Fork, Miss., Ashley and study co-author Victor Gensini, another meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University and a longtime tornado expert, said they are watching the potential for another supercell blow-up in the Mid-South on Friday., Past studies have been unable to forecast supercells and tornadoes in future climate simulations because they are small-scale events, especially tornadoes, that global computer models can't see. Ashley and Gensini used smaller regional computer models and compensated for their reduced computing power by spending two years running simulations and crunching data., Three scientists not connected to the study said it makes sense. One of them, Pennsylvania State University tornado scientist Paul Markowski, called it a promising advance because it explicitly simulated storms, compared to past research that only looked at general environments favorable to supercells., While the study finds a general increase in supercell counts, what it mostly finds are large shifts in where and when they hit — generally, more east of Interstate 35, which runs through east central Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, and fewer to the west., In moderate warming – less warming than the world is headed for based on current emissions – parts of eastern Mississippi and eastern Oklahoma are projected to get three more supercells every two years, with eastern Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, western Tennessee and eastern Georgia getting one more supercell every other year., With worst-case warming — more than the world is presently on track for — the study projects similar changes but with worsening supercells over eastern Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri., Cities that should see more supercells as warming worsens include Dallas-Fort Worth, Little Rock, Memphis, Jackson, Tupelo, Birmingham and Nashville, Ashley said., The moderate warming simulation projects 61% more supercells in March and 46% more in April, while the more severe warming scenario has 119% more in March and 82% more in April. They see double-digit percentage point drops in June and July., In the mid-South, including Rolling Fork, the study projects supercell activity peaking two hours later, from 6 to 9 p.m. instead of 4 to 7 p.m. That means more nighttime supercells., ""If you want a disaster, create a supercell at night where you can't go outside and visually confirm the threat'' so people don't take it as seriously, Gensini said., The eastward shift also puts more people at risk because those areas are more densely populated than the traditional tornado alley of Kansas and Oklahoma, Ashley and Gensini said. The population coming under more risk is also poorer and more frequently lives in mobile or manufactured homes, which are more dangerous places in a tornado., What's likely happening as the climate warms is the Southwest United States is getting hotter and drier, Ashley and Gensini said. Meanwhile, the Gulf of Mexico, which provides the crucial moisture for the storms, is getting hotter and the air coming from there is getting juicier and unstable., The hot dry air from places like New Mexico puts a stronger ""cap"" on where storms would normally brew when air masses collide in spring time. That cap means storms can't quite boil over as much in the Great Plains. The pressure builds as the weather front moves east, leading to supercells forming later and farther eastward, Gensini and Ashley said., Because February and March are getting warmer than they used to be this will happen earlier in the year, but by July and August the cap of hot dry air is so strong that supercells have a hard time forming, Ashley and Gensini said., It's like playing with a pair of dice loaded against you, Ashley said. One of those dice is making the odds worse because of more people in the way and the other one is loaded with more supercells ""increasing the odds of the perils too, tornadoes and hail.""",Climate

But what exactly is a heat pump, and why do some call it a key climate solution? Julia Simon of NPR's Climate Desk has this report. In a backyard near Oakland, in between the wind whistling through bamboo and the meowing of a cat... ...There's another small sound - the very low whir of a heat pump. Owner James Tucker got it installed last year. It goes to a fan box in the attic that blows the cool and the heat into the house. That's right. Heat pumps can also cool your home. A lot of people dislike the name heat pump, right? Some people want to call them heat and cool pumps or something like that, but I think we're kind of stuck with the name. Kevin Kircher is a professor of engineering at Purdue University. He says you can think of a heat pump as an air conditioner that can also work backwards, using electricity to move heat into your home. Now, there's a new incentive for Americans to get heat pumps from last year's federal climate legislation. An IRS spokesperson told NPR that there are now credits that can translate to up to $2,000 for heat pumps. Kevin Hanley, coordinator at a heat pump installer in Lincoln, Neb., says the new rebates are now cutting the payback time. The rebates are such that it makes a heat pump really worth considering for all homeowners. The Biden administration and governments around the world see heat pumps as a key climate solution. They can replace gas furnaces in homes, and they run on electricity that's increasingly powered by renewables. Yannick Monschauer of the International Energy Agency in Paris says if governments like the U.S. and the EU meet their national climate and energy targets... We see that heat pumps could bring down global CO2 emissions by half a gigaton by the end of this decade. That's a lot of emissions. So that is comparable to the annual emissions of Canada. While in the past heat pumps didn't work well in cold climates, Monschauer says there's been a lot of improvement. In fact, in the coldest parts of Europe, we also have the highest shares of heat pumps. So in Norway, for example, 60% of the households are equipped with heat pumps. So it's definitely proven that it's possible. In the U.S., about 14% of homes have heat pumps. Heating technicians say, this year, demand is growing.Julia Simon, NPR News. ",Climate

Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, An aerial view of neighborhood in Rolling Fork, Miss., destroyed by Friday night's tornado., Rural communities in western Mississippi are surveying and cleaning up the damage after an unusual and powerful tornado tore through the area Friday night., The tornado killed at least 25 people in Mississippi and one in Alabama, destroyed buildings and left hundreds without shelter., The tornado landed in Rolling Fork around 8 p.m. local time before blowing through nearby towns including Silver City, Black Hawk and Winona, staying on the ground for an hour and 10 minutes., The National Weather Service says it spanned roughly 170 miles and had a path of 59.4 miles, an unusually long distance compared to what it calls a typical tornado path of 1-2 miles., The NWS has given the tornado a preliminary rating of 4 out of 5 on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale, which estimates wind speeds (in this case, 166-200 mph) based on the damage caused., ""This is one of the more rare tornadoes that we've seen in recorded Mississippi history given its longevity and strength over a period of time,"" National Weather Service meteorologist Lance Perrilloux told NPR., People following the devastating news out of the region may be wondering: (How) was the storm related to climate change?, After all, most of the extreme weather events that have dominated headlines recently — from heat waves to atmospheric rivers to historic floods — have had a clear connection to high temperatures, record rainfall and other effects of a warming planet., Years of research have shown how climate change intensifies rain storms, heat waves and hurricanes, as NPR has reported., The same can't exactly be said for tornadoes, however., Scientists know that warm weather is a key ingredient in tornadoes and that climate change is altering the environment in which these kinds of storms form. But they can't directly connect those dots, as the research into the link between climate and tornadoes still lags behind that of other extreme weather events such as hurricanes and wildfire., That's at least in part due to a lack of data — even though the U.S. leads the world in tornadoes, averaging about 1,200 a year., Less than 10% of severe thunderstorms produce tornadoes, which makes it tricky to draw firm conclusions about the processes leading up to them and how they might be influenced by climate change, Harold Brooks, a tornado scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory, told The Associated Press in 2021., Other factors that make that climate change attribution difficult include the quality of the observational record and the ability of models to simulate certain weather events. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says that's the case with tornadoes., ""The observational record is not consistent and relatively short, the models remain inconclusive as to replicating tornado activity, and our understanding of how global warming and climate change will influence the different atmospheric processes that produce tornadoes (wind shear, for example) is more limited,"" reads a page on its website., While scientists may not be able to conclusively connect tornado frequency or intensity to human-caused climate change, they say there are signs pointing in that direction., Here's what they do know:, NOAA defines tornadoes as narrow, violently rotating columns of air that extend from a thunderstorm to the ground (while the wind part is invisible, tornadoes can form condensation funnels of water droplets, dust and debris). They can be among the most violent of natural disasters, ripping homes apart, tearing through infrastructure and sending debris flying., Tornadoes can occur in any part of the U.S. at any time of year., They have historically been associated with the Great Plains, though experts say the idea of a so-called ""Tornado Alley"" can be misleading since the tornado threat is a bit of a moving target. It shifts from the Southeast in the cooler months of the year, toward the southern and central Plains in May and June, and the northern Plains and Midwest during early summer., When people talk about ""tornado season,"" they are usually referring to the time of year when the U.S. sees the most tornadoes — which peaks in May and June in the southern Plains and later in the northern Plains and upper Midwest., Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes tend to start ramping up in the month of March (usually doubling from February), with the threat most concentrated in Southern states. That's the result of the clash between winter and spring weather patterns, with a still-strong jet stream and warmer air moving northward., Recent Marches have been especially active, the Weather Channel notes: There were 236 recorded tornadoes in March 2022, the most in that month since 1950., A rare and powerful tornado tore through Los Angeles County, Calif., last week, damaging buildings like this one in the city of Montebello. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, A rare and powerful tornado tore through Los Angeles County, Calif., last week, damaging buildings like this one in the city of Montebello., This particular tornado — one of at least 10 reported in Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee from this storm — had its origins in a type of rotating thunderstorm known as a supercell., The storm system started earlier in the week in California, where it spawned the strongest tornado to hit Los Angeles County since 1983. It then continued its journey east, triggering deadly floods in Arizona and the central swath of the country and gaining strength along the way., Many states saw record-high temperatures during this period, and the Washington Post explains that the warm and humid air — exacerbated by unusually high sea surface temperatures over the Gulf of Mexico — helped energize the storm., Warm winds from the south fueled the storm at ground level, it adds, while westerly winds of the jet stream generated extreme amounts of ""wind shear"" — the change in wind speed and/or direction with height that can lead to the development of tornadoes., The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says as few as 20% of all supercell thunderstorms produce tornadoes, but that those are the most common — and often the most dangerous — kind of twister., NOAA compares supercells to cancer cells in a living organism, because ""the rotation of their updraft enables them to overcome the self-limiting mechanisms that bring demise to regular storms,"" lasting for ""an appreciable length of time"" and causing damage all the while., Storm chasers and meteorologists have described Friday's event as a ""wedge tornado,"" a slang term meaning its funnel is at least as wide on the ground as it is tall., Its maximum path width was 3/4 mile, the NWS says, which might help explain the extent of the damage., Experts say other factors could include the disproportionate number of mobile homes (which are more vulnerable to tornado damage) in the Southeast U.S., the nighttime arrival of the tornado and a relatively short warning period: The NWS issued its first tornado warning just some 20 minutes before the storm reached Rolling Fork., About 75% of Rolling Fork — a predominantly Black town of about 2,000 people — is ""pretty much flattened,"" NPR's Debbie Elliott reported on Monday., Most walls are gone but furniture remains intact where a home once stood in Rolling Fork, Mississippi. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption, Most walls are gone but furniture remains intact where a home once stood in Rolling Fork, Mississippi., Experts say climate change is impacting the conditions in which tornadoes form and could lead to changes in when and where the U.S. sees them., John T. Allen, a professor of meteorology at Central Michigan University, wrote in a USA Today opinion column that while ties to climate change are still uncertain, there appears to have been an ""eastward shift in tornado frequency"" and increasing frequency of tornadoes in outbreaks over the past few decades., ""Climate projections for the late 21st century have suggested that the conditions favorable to the development of the severe storms that produce tornadoes will increase over North America, and the impact could be greatest in the winter and fall,"" he added., Brooks, of NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory, said the U.S. is likely to see more tornadoes in the winter (and fewer in the summer) as national temperatures rise above the long-term average., And Gensini told Axios that projections show an increase in major outbreaks in the mid-South and Southeast. He also compared tornado-climate change attribution to the steroids era of baseball, as Axios put it: ""Pinning an individual home run on steroid use is difficult, he said, but in the aggregate the trends are evident."", A version of this story first appeared in 2021.",Climate

Each spring, when monsoon rains arrive, a web of narrow rivers – like capillaries crisscrossing the flesh of the country – swell into a shallow sea., But these annual floods – the lifeblood of the region's agricultural cycle – have become erratic in recent years. And last year's were the worst Begum had seen in her 60 years., In June, the water edged up slowly – and then all at once – sweeping away her thatch and bamboo home., ""Pretty soon we'll be living in the tops of trees!"" Begum says, rubbing bony fish against a blade in the new makeshift kitchen she's assembled on a muddy tract where her house used to be. ""Either that or this land will be strewn with our bodies."", Begum lives a two-hour boat ride from the nearest road – and farther still from any flood shelter. She doesn't read or write and doesn't have a cellphone., But before the floodwaters overwhelmed her home, Begum knew precisely when to evacuate – and how to save her own life. That's because of a human chain of communication that relies both on high-tech forecasting and low-tech relationships., It's what scientists say Bangladesh, a relatively poor country, nevertheless does best: A mix of technology and community solutions that are saving lives on the frontlines of climate change., Golabari village in the region of Sunamganj, northern Bangladesh. This area experienced some of the country's worst flooding in June 2022. Fatima Tuj Johora for NPR hide caption, Golabari village in the region of Sunamganj, northern Bangladesh. This area experienced some of the country's worst flooding in June 2022., Bangladesh is often called a climate victim. It contributes only a tiny fraction of global carbon emissions – 0.56%, by one count. But it suffers disproportionately from their effects., Its low-lying geography, south of the Himalayan mountains, means it's particularly vulnerable to flooding as glaciers melt and sea levels rise. Its agriculture relies on monsoon rains that increasingly come in spasms. And it gets battered with some of the world's worst cyclones., But fatalities from those rains and cyclones have fallen dramatically. For example: In 1970, Cyclone Bhola killed up to half a million people in what is now Bangladesh, while last year's Cyclone Sitrang killed 16., Part of the reason is what Saleemul Huq, director of the Bangladesh-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development, calls social capital – awareness., ""I tell my American friends, 'You should send your skeptics to Bangladesh! The awareness of climate change here is the highest in the world,' "" Huq says. ""But we have gone through the doom and gloom phase. That's yesterday's news in Bangladesh. "", Now it's all about solutions, he says., Bangladesh uses satellites to track cyclones and shares that information with neighboring countries. It's anchored buoys offshore that are equipped with solar-powered sensors to measure sea level and transmit that data to scientists on dry land., In Begum's region, residents adapt to life around more water by splitting their time between agriculture in the dry season and fishing in the rainy season. Some continue to farm year-round by weaving together bamboo and water hyacinth roots to create a floating farm – a hammock on which to plant seeds to grow bitter gourds, spinach and okra, partially submerged in flooded rivers., In coastal areas farther south, farmers are using saline-resistant varieties of rice so that as sea levels rise in the Bay of Bengal, the influx of salt water doesn't poison freshwater crops. They're harvesting rainwater and also building pond sand filtration systems to purify brackish water and ensure a safe supply for drinking., Riverboats are the primary mode of transportation in the region of Sunamganj in northern Bangladesh.

""Using indigenous knowledge, we're coping and surviving. We are trying to reclaim our life."", Most critically, the government has partnered with cellphone providers to extend 4G coverage to areas that might not even have electricity or plumbing., ""So that when something happens, almost everybody on land gets the message, gets to shelter and survives. It's not the technology, it's social capital – people knowing what to do,"" Huq says. ""That is Bangladesh's biggest asset."", Last June, a few days before Begum's house washed away, scientists in Bangladesh's capital noticed something unusual: An unprecedented amount of rain forecast for the Himalayan foothills across the border in India. It's an area that's been deforested in recent years., ""There's no grass or trees on those hills, so the water just rushes downstream,"" explains Partho Protim Barua, an engineer at the country's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre in the capital Dhaka., It rushes downstream, across the Indian border, into low-lying Bangladesh., That day, Barua called up his colleague Nazma Akter in the far north of the country, near the Indian border. She's a housewife with a side job reading a gauge in her local river, the Wah Umngi or Umngot River, which flows from India's Meghalaya state southward into the Surma River in Bangladesh., The gauge looks like a yardstick stuck in the riverbank. Akter, 26, checks it five times a day, records water levels and sends her readings to Dhaka's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre by text message – on her indestructible old Nokia brick phone., Nazma Akter, 26, works as a gauge reader for Bangladesh's Flood Forecasting & Warning Centre.

She reads water levels in a river near her home in the Sylhet district of northern Bangladesh and sends data to engineers in Dhaka by SMS., Bangladesh relies on hundreds of people like Akter – regular folks, not scientists – who monitor water levels at rivers, streams and reservoirs across the country. They act as scouts for the scientists, looking for signs of trouble on the front lines of climate change., Akter recalls how last June, the river showed a 2.5-meter rise – around 8 feet – over three days. It was a sign of massive rainfall to the north – just as Barua had seen in the forecast – even before local skies clouded over., Akter, who has just a high school education, says she realized what was coming: Some of the worst flash floods ever to hit her country., So she increased the frequency of her trips out to the river to read the gauge from five times a day to every hour – even as her own family prepared to evacuate., ""Suddenly the sky grew dark here, and people started panicking. Then my own house flooded!"" Akter recalls. ""Still, I went out in the rain and checked the gauge every hour. I had to – it's my duty."", Back at the government's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre in Dhaka, Barua, the engineer, says he was in disbelief when he received Akter's text messages. He plugged her hourly data into his hydrological models, triple-checked it for accuracy — and was astounded., ""The rivers there are very narrow, so the water level rises suddenly,"" he explains. ""But this broke records from the last 100 to 150 years!"", So he grabbed a little microphone attached to his desktop computer and recorded a message on June 19, 2022., A water level gauge in a tributary of the Surma River in northern Bangladesh.

The two-minute message goes on to list regions of northern Bangladesh where flood risk was high – and imminent., ""We try to keep it as simple as possible and as short as possible,"" Barua explains. ""Basically, what's going to happen in each area in the next three to five days."", He uploads the audio to a website where it's accessible by all of Bangladesh's mobile phone operators – and then holds his breath, hoping people will get it in time., On June 19, 2022, Barua's message went out on Bangladesh's emergency warning system as a smartphone push notification. The government recently signed a deal with Google to expand that service. His warning also went out as an analog SMS text message, and as an audio recording accessible on a toll-free number – so that even folks with bulky Nokia brick phones like Akter's can receive it., ""Everybody in Bangladesh has a mobile phone – almost 100% penetration. So they can get text messages, and a growing number have smartphones, where they can actually see the satellite image, track the cyclone and figure out how long they have to get to the shelter,"" Huq explains.

Rebuilding is part of our seasonal cycle now,"" says Bilal Ahmed, 42, a local resident and musician. ""But we have to live here. We have nowhere else to go."", Since last year's devastating floods, Ahmed has been reviving old Bangladeshi folk songs that celebrate seasonal rains as bringing life rather than trauma. He performs them at weddings and festivals. He's also been writing new songs, with lyrics encouraging people not to chop down trees, or toss litter., Because deforestation exacerbates flooding, residents of Golabari village in northern Bangladesh have started using sticks of cow dung rather than wood as fuel for cooking.

Buckle up as we journey beyond the headlines and sail out to sea, blast off to space and then find our way home with the help of some dancing bees!, If you are visiting a beach lately, you may be seeing and smelling something a little bit different. A giant floating mat of the algae, known as the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt, begins in West Africa and stretches across the Atlantic before swirling into the Gulf of Mexico. The large blob of plant matter has continued to grow every year — and can even be seen from space. The blob of plant matter is both destructive since it smothers coral reefs and marinas, and, once ashore, releases ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which smells like rotting eggs and can cause respiratory problems., Read more reporting on this topic from our colleague Emily Olson., In 2019, a spacecraft named Hayabusa 2 landed on a diamond-shaped asteroid near Earth called Ryugu. Researchers began studying samples of the asteroid and announced earlier this year that they found a bunch of organic molecules. The latest molecule found was uracil, a nucleobase of RNA. One of those researchers Yasuhiro Oba at Hokkaido University, told Geoff via email that this is the first time they have detected a nucleobase in a sample from a rock that isn't from Earth. Some believe the building blocks of life came from asteroids like Ryugu. This discovery could lead us closer to understanding how life began on Earth., If you know anything about bees, you may have heard of the waggle dance, which is how honeybees communicate to find pollen or nectar and return to the hive. Recently, a new study shared that this waggle dance may be more complex. A team of researchers from Germany, China and the United States tagged the bees that witnessed the dance and released them at different locations hundreds of meters from the hive – and pointed in different directions than the hive. They found that most of the tagged bees got to the food source from the dance. So rather than just directions from the hive, the waggle seems to be more of a map of their surroundings., Have suggestions for what we should cover in our next news roundup?

Reservoirs levels plummeted over the last three years, but now have more water than they can hold. Ken James/California Department of Water Resources hide caption, Water pours out of Lake Oroville in Northern California in March. Reservoirs levels plummeted over the last three years, but now have more water than they can hold., Ask a water expert if California's drought is finally done, and the answers sound something like this:, ""Yes and no."" ""Kind of."" ""Depends what you mean by drought."", The state has been deluged by storms this winter, hit by 12 atmospheric rivers that have led to evacuation orders, rising rivers and broken levees. In some parts of the Sierra Nevada, more than 55 feet of snow have fallen., With reservoirs filling up, many Californians are eager to put the severe, 3-year drought behind them. A major water supplier in Southern California recently lifted mandatory conservation rules that limited outdoor watering. Large parts of the state are now free of drought, according to the federal government's Drought Monitor, which looks at rainfall and soil moisture., But in California, water shortages aren't just due to a lack of rain, and the state's chronic water problems are far from over., ""While we've seen some pretty fantastic wet weather and we've seen conditions improve, in a whole lot of places we still have some lingering impacts that still challenge California,"" says Mike Anderson, the state's climatologist., Decades of drought have taken their toll, and experts say that deeper issues need to be addressed before California can be fully-drought free. Here are three reasons why:, When California's reservoirs declined, many cities and farmers turned to another water source: vast aquifers underground., In drought years, groundwater has supplied up to 60% of California's water. But the pumping has been largely unregulated. So over the decades, water levels have fallen dramatically in California's aquifers. Before this winter, some groundwater wells were at the lowest points ever recorded. That's because in the Central Valley, groundwater hasn't been replenished after previous droughts., ""Groundwater is the dark matter of the hydrologic cycle,"" says Graham Fogg, professor emeritus of hydrogeology at the University of California Davis. ""The fact that these are such huge volumes of water allows them to take a lot of abuse and to be depleted year after year."", Floodwater in Fresno County, Calif., is diverted onto agricultural land, so it can seep into underground aquifers. Groundwater levels have fallen dramatically during the state's droughts. Andrew Innerarity/California Department of Water Resources hide caption, Floodwater in Fresno County, Calif., is diverted onto agricultural land, so it can seep into underground aquifers. Groundwater levels have fallen dramatically during the state's droughts., As a result, more than 2,000 household wells went dry over the last three years in California, many in low-income communities of color. Temporary water supplies, including bottled water, had to be brought in., ""We're not out of a drought,"" says Susana De Anda, executive director of the Community Water Center, an environmental justice organization in the Central Valley. ""In California, the human right to water was passed in 2012. Unfortunately to this day, many Californians don't have that reality, and it's important to recognize that."", This winter, a new effort is underway to use some of the floodwaters to fill aquifers. California is also in the process of implementing a new groundwater law, intended to get over-pumping under control. Water users are currently writing plans for keeping groundwater use in balance with supply, but they won't be fully implemented until 2040., ""Over the years, pretty consistently, California has been using a lot more water than its surface water and groundwater system can supply,"" Fogg says. ""So that has to change."", Most of California's major cities exist today because their water is delivered from hundreds of miles away. In Southern California, that distance is thousands of miles, because the region uses water from the Colorado River., A two-decades long drought has hit the Colorado River hard, causing its massive reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, to plummet. Climate change is shrinking the snowpack that feeds the river, and the seven states that use it have long made claim to more water than is available on average., Heavy storms caused a levee to break in Pajaro, Calif., flooding nearby homes. The parade of winter storms has tested the state's infrastructure. Ken James/California Department of Water Resources hide caption, Heavy storms caused a levee to break in Pajaro, Calif., flooding nearby homes. The parade of winter storms has tested the state's infrastructure., Those states are now in emergency negotiations over cutbacks to their water supply, but are struggling to agree. With some of the oldest water rights on the river, California has seniority and is technically last in line for cuts. But its water supply will still be impacted. Many Southern California cities have been working on conserving and recycling water locally, so they're less dependent on faraway supplies., ""We just have to get better at managing the more limited resources that we have there, and that means figuring out how to share a smaller pool of water than what we've been using up till now,"" says Ellen Hanak, director of the Water Policy Center at the Public Policy Institute of California., Cue the John Steinbeck quote – it's easy to forget about the dry times once the rains come. But drought will return., ""We always have to be ready,"" Hanak says. ""Drier times could come again as soon as next year."", As the climate gets hotter, California's extremes are expected to get more extreme. That means droughts will be drier, putting even greater strain on the state's water supply., After the last major drought ended in California in 2017, some water conservation behavior seemed to stick. Water use didn't rebound to pre-drought levels, because some residents made lasting changes, like replacing water-hungry lawns and swapping for more efficient fixtures and appliances., Still, experts warn that keeping a drought-mindset can only help California weather future challenges. So there's a risk in acting like drought is a thing of the past. Saving water now could help keep reservoirs fuller, a safe bet in a state where next year's winter storms are never guaranteed.",Climate

Extreme heat and drought brought on by climate change are partly to blame, but so is the aging infrastructure and years of mismanaging water., Mexico is not the only place struggling with wide-scale water insecurity. Around 2 billion people around the world do not have access to clean and safe drinking water, and approximately 3.6 billion people – 46% of the world's population – lack adequate sanitation services, according to a new United Nations World Water Development Report released Wednesday., ""Water insecurity leads to a number of other insecurities,"" said Richard Connor, editor-in-chief of the report. ""If you don't have enough water to grow food, you will end up with food insecurity."", The new report was released Wednesday at the U.N. water conference in New York – the first major U.N. conference devoted to water since 1977. It lays out the challenges facing the U.N.'s sustainability goals to secure clean water and sanitation for all people by 2030. The U.N. estimates such efforts could exceed $1 trillion each year., The report also warns the world is headed toward an imminent water crisis if efforts aren't made to mitigate and adapt to human-caused climate change and population growth., ""Seasonal water scarcity will increase in regions where it is currently abundant — such as Central Africa, East Asia and parts of South America — and worsen in regions where water is already in short supply, such as the Middle East and the Sahara in Africa,"" the report states., Water scarcity is further complicated by the massive amounts of water needed to grow crops. Around 70% of freshwater globally goes to agriculture, and about one third of the world's cities already compete with agriculture for water, according to the U.N. report. Competition will only increase as the urban demand for water is predicted to grow by 80% within the next three decades., Without efforts to adapt to these demographic changes and the effects of climate change, the number of people facing water scarcity in cities is expected to double to somewhere between 1.7 billion and 2.4 billion, the report finds., ""Ironically, we're talking about the same water that is needed to grow the crops to feed the cities. So there has to be a greater cooperation agreement, (an) approach, to meet both the needs of cities that are rapidly expanding in many parts of the world and the farmers,"" Connor said., Residents of the El Cardon community, who do not receive drinking water at home, carry buckets and drums with water collected from a natural pond formed in a tunnel in Caracas, Venezuela.

The group works to help local communities that are experiencing water insecurity by installing systems in homes to capture rain that's used primarily for non-drinking water purposes., ""We started realizing what to us felt like an obvious thing, which is, you know, this city [Mexico City] that's running out of water, but that has so many millions upon millions of gallons of water falling on it every year from the sky, everywhere, should really start harvesting that water,"" said Enrique Lomnitz, general director and cofounder of Isla Urbana., Since launching in 2009, Isla Urbana has installed about 33,000 rainwater harvesting systems in homes and 500 schools throughout Mexico, Lomnitz said. The group's work spans from water-insecure neighborhoods in Mexico City, like Iztapalapa in the east, to rural and Indigenous communities in the southern part of the country, where fewer people have water hook-ups., ""If the government wants to help, that's great,"" Lomnitz said. ""But you don't need the government to catch rainwater and put it in a tank and use it... And I guess to us that just felt like a beautiful and empowering thing."" Isla Urbana now does most of its work through government contracts, he explained., Governments and partnerships are critical, according to Connor, in addressing a world facing a water crisis., Dawn at Bullfrog Marina on Lake Powell in Utah.

Waterlines on the rocks in the background show how far the water has dropped in recent years., What drives water scarcity, Unprecedented population growth, development and changing consumption patterns are testing the world's water supply. Wastewater – including agricultural runoff – also contributes and is the main cause of water pollution, according to the report., Droughts, flooding and other extreme weather events fueled by climate change are also exacerbating water shortages and quality globally., In Kenya and Somalia, for example, prolonged drought continues to devastate crops and livestock. In the U.S., some citizens of the Navajo Nation, which spans from northern Arizona into New Mexico, don't have running water and must bring water to their homes. Meanwhile, the Colorado River, which supplies millions of people in the American West with water, is dwindling. Hurricanes and flooding are also wreaking havoc on water infrastructure and contaminating water supplies worldwide., ""How people experience climate change has a lot to do with water,"" Lauren Herzer Risi, program director of the Environmental Change and Security Program at the Wilson Center, said., ""Water has to sort of come out of its silo,"" Risi said. More than half of the global population lives in water basins that are shared with other countries, she said, and like the authors of the U.N. report, Risi stressed the importance of cooperation and management of water across country borders., ""What happens is as people sort of respond to climate pressures – whether it's building dams or otherwise – that has downstream effects,"" said Risi. ""So if you don't have institutions in place and sort of agreements in place to manage those sorts of big changes, then that's where we see conflict."", A woman balances a water can on her head while people collect water from a mobile water tanker in a residential area in New Delhi, India. Altaf Qadri/AP hide caption, Critical water partnerships, The U.N. report focuses on water partnerships that view water as a shared resource, such as water funds, which encourage good farming practices while also improving watersheds., Here's how this idea works: Downstream water users, such as a city or a utility company, invest money in farmers operating upstream so they can adopt irrigation methods that require less water. High-efficient irrigation, in turn, saves water that people downstream can use., The water fund also can be used to rehabilitate ecosystems upstream through soil conservation and to protect wetlands, which act as natural sponges to absorb and release water and filter pollutants, helping bolster water quality and availability., Water funds have been especially popular in Latin American countries, Connor said. African and Asian countries have also adopted this idea in recent years. The Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund in Kenya and the Monterrey Metropolitan Water Fund in Mexico are examples of water funds that have investments from the private and public sectors., Water funds are just one approach to help reduce the global threat to water scarcity, said Connor. Ultimately, he said governments, financiers, and investors must work together with climate and water policymakers., The global water crisis requires a shift from seeing water as an owned commodity to one that is shared and is vital for the planet's future, Connor said., ""With increasing demand, with population growth and more vulnerable resources because of climate change, this cooperation is becoming – has always been essential – but now it's even more essential if we're going to solve any of these problems,"" Connor said.",Climate

And the activists point out their economic influence too: Baby boomers own over half of U.S. wealth., ""Part of the thing that's really interesting about today [Tuesday] is that, for once, it's not just being left up to young people to do this work,"" said McKibben, who was in Washington, D.C., for the protest there. ""That's important in this case, in part, because older Americans have about 70% of the country's financial assets. So it's particularly appropriate that they're putting pressure on here."", That message wasn't lost on Bob Follansbee, 73, who biked a half-hour from his home in Dorchester to downtown Boston. ""I feel it's incumbent on us to stand up for the next generations coming and do what we can as the people who are, kind of, of age and of some resources,"" said Follansbee. He also said one of the reasons he went is that his generation is responsible for a lot of the climate change., The demonstrations happened a day after a United Nations report was released showing that the world is on track to face catastrophic warming. However, world leaders already have the necessary tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save lives, according to the report. The authors of the report hope it will give guidance for political leaders who will gather later this year for international negotiations on how to limit emissions., McKibben said the world faces a ""balancing act"" trying to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from the economy. ""We're not going to be off oil and gas tomorrow, sadly,"" he said. ""That's why we've been very clear in saying our only demand is that these guys [banks] stop funding the expansion of the fossil fuel industry."", Citi, one of the banks where protests happened Tuesday, said in an emailed statement that the bank ""shares the goal of transitioning to a low-carbon economy."" The company pointed to efforts to invest in ""clean energy solutions through our net zero commitments and our $1 trillion commitment to sustainable finance.""

""Typically you need acts of [C]ongress or much more elevated political/branding pressure,"" Compton wrote in an email., ""The banks have also rejected shareholder resolutions in the past that would have limited funding of fossil fuels,"" Compton said. ""At the end of the day, banks serve a complex set of interests and constituencies, so bringing about wide ranging changes through demands from a select group of constituents is difficult."", Still, McKibben remains hopeful.

World Water Development Report 2023 painted a stark picture of the huge gap that needs to be filled to meet U.N. goals to ensure all people have access to clean water and sanitation by 2030., Richard Connor, editor-in-chief of the report, told a news conference that the estimated cost of meeting the goals is somewhere between $600 billion and $1 trillion a year., But equally important, Connor said, is forging partnerships with investors, financiers, governments and climate change communities to ensure that money is invested in ways to sustain the environment and provide potable water to the 2 billion people who don't have it and sanitation to the 3.6 million in need., According to the report, water use has been increasing globally by roughly 1% per year over the last 40 years ""and is expected to grow at a similar rate through to 2050, driven by a combination of population growth, socio-economic development and changing consumption patterns."", Connor said that actual increase in demand is happening in developing countries and emerging economies where it is driven by industrial growth and especially the rapid increase in the population of cities. It is in these urban areas ""that you're having a real big increase in demand,"" he said., With agriculture using 70% of all water globally, Connor said, irrigation for crops has to be more efficient — as it is in some countries that now use drip irrigation, which saves water. ""That allows water to be available to cities,"" he said., As a result of climate change, the report said, ""seasonal water scarcity will increase in regions where it is currently abundant — such as Central Africa, East Asia and parts of South America — and worsen in regions where water is already in short supply, such as the Middle East and the Sahara in Africa."", On average, ""10% of the global population lives in countries with high or critical water stress"" — and up to 3.5 billion people live under conditions of water stress at least one month a year, said the report issued by UNESCO, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization., Since 2000, floods in the tropics have quadrupled while floods in the north mid-latitudes have increased 2.5-fold, the report said. Trends in droughts are more difficult to establish, it said, ""although an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts and 'heat extremes' can be expected in most regions as a direct result of climate change."", As for water pollution, Connor said, the biggest source of pollution is untreated wastewater., ""Globally, 80 percent of wastewater is released to the environment without any treatment,"" he said, ""and in many developing countries it's pretty much 99%."", These and other issues including protecting aquatic ecosystems, improving management of water resources, increasing water reuse and promoting cooperation across borders on water use will be discussed during the three-day U.N. Water Conference co-chaired by King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and Tajikistan's President Emomali Rahmon opening Wednesday morning., There are 171 countries, including over 100 ministers, on the speakers list along with more than 20 organizations.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption, The Colorado River flows by the historic Navajo Bridge on June 23, 2021 in Marble Canyon, Ariz., On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could alter the already intense battle over water rights in the parched American Southwest., For more than 20 years, the Navajo Nation has fought for access to water from the lower Colorado River, which flows directly alongside the reservation's northwestern border., The Navajo Nation reservation stretches across 27,000 square miles in Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. Almost a third of the 170,000 people who live there do not have access to clean, reliable drinking water, the tribe says., Thousands who live without running water must drive for miles to refill barrels and jugs to haul water home for drinking, cooking, bathing and cleaning. Others rely on unregulated wells., But the issue of access to the Colorado River is extremely contentious., A decades-long drought, exacerbated by climate change, has created the driest conditions that the American Southwest has seen in centuries. The region's water supply is dwindling as its population and agricultural output have boomed., The river, which provides water for 40 million people across the entire Southwest, is already overtapped. The seven states that rely on the river have long been embroiled in litigation over the body of water. Recently, they have struggled to reach an agreement on how to cut back on their water use., But the Navajo Nation says it has not been able to fully represent its own interests in disputes over water. Instead, they say they've been blocked in court by the U.S. federal government, which says it represents tribal interests in water disputes., The tribe's claim stems from federal policies that forcibly relocated tribes and their citizens westward and onto reservations, including the Navajo Treaty of 1868, said Heather Tanana, a law professor at the University of Utah., ""When they established these reservations, that came with the promise that those lands would be permanent homelands for the tribe and their people,"" said Tanana, who is a citizen of Navajo Nation. ""And I think everyone would agree you can't have a homeland of any kind without water."", Both the tribe and the U.S. government agree that Indian reservations, including the Navajo Nation, have a right to water., Now, the Supreme Court must decide how far the federal government's responsibilities go in reserving that right., ""Is the federal government the trustee and the Navajo Nation the beneficiary, such that ordinary trust law principles can be applied?"" said Gregory Ablavsky, who specializes in federal Indian law at Stanford Law School. Ordinarily, he explained, a beneficiary can sue a trustee for mismanaging the trust — in this case, water., Sympathy for the tribe's position came from Justice Neil Gorsuch, a frequent supporter of Native rights who has often split from his fellow conservatives on cases involving Indian treaties., ""Could I bring a good breach-of-contract claim for someone who promised me a permanent home, the right to conduct agriculture and raise animals if it turns out it's the Sahara Desert?"" Gorsuch asked during Monday's oral arguments. (No, the government's lawyer replied.), The U.S. has argued that a broad ruling in favor of the Navajo Nation could force the federal government to conduct an assessment of the tribe's water needs and build water supply infrastructure. Those responsibilities belong to the tribe, the government says., ""Just as the 1868 treaty didn't impose on the United States a duty to build roads or bridges, or to harvest timber, or to mine coal, the 1868 treaty didn't impose on the United States a duty to construct pipelines, pumps or wells to deliver water,"" said Frederick Liu, an assistant to the solicitor general, addressing the court., Several of the court's conservatives, including Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, appeared sensitive to that concern during Monday's hearing, which prompted assurances from Shay Dvoretzky, the attorney arguing on behalf of the Navajo Nation., ""The government hypothesizes a parade of horribles where the government would have to be building pipelines across miles and miles and miles of territory,"" Dvoretzky said. ""We're not talking about anything like that."", States that rely on the Colorado River — including Arizona, California and Nevada — also oppose the tribe's efforts, saying that diverting water to the reservation would come at the expense of their states' populations and economies., A favorable ruling would not immediately solve the tribe's water access issues, experts said. But it would allow the tribe's legal efforts around the Colorado River and other waterways to move forward., ""There isn't enough water. But that doesn't mean that the Navajo Nation does not have valid rights that should be enforced, that they should have the ability to develop their water and then play on the same level with every other stakeholder in the basin,"" said Tanana of the University of Utah.",Law

That is the message from the United Nations. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced the release of a major climate science report earlier today. We have never been better equipped to solve the climate challenge, but we must move into warp speed climate action now. We don't have a moment to lose. Rebecca Hersher from NPR's Climate Desk has more. The report doesn't mince words. The Earth is on track for catastrophic warming, and world leaders need to slash greenhouse gas emissions immediately. Here's Dr. Hoesung Lee, who led the writing of the report. We are walking when we should be sprinting. Here's what sprinting would look like, according to the report - no new power plants that burn coal, oil or gas; no more subsidies to extract fossil fuels from the ground; lots of investment in solar and wind; and big changes to how we farm, how and where we build homes and how we warn people about extreme weather. Patricia Romero-Lankao is a climate scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. She says the main message for world leaders is that there are already lots of practical options to tackle climate change.- There are many available, cost-effective and affordable solutions to reduce emissions in transport, in industry, in housing, in our daily activities. The new report is really short - just 36 pages - which is the whole point. It's meant to be like a cheat sheet if the first question on the pop quiz for world leaders was how will you prevent catastrophic climate change and the second question was how will you protect your most vulnerable citizens?ROMERO- The poorest and most marginalized communities are the most vulnerable in all cities and in all regions. That includes in the U.S., where poor people, Indigenous people and people of color are more vulnerable to rising seas, to stronger storms and deadly heat waves. And the report points out that, globally, the people who are most at risk don't release a lot of greenhouse gases. Here's Inger Andersen, the head of the U.N. Environment Program. Climate change is throwing its hardest punches at the most vulnerable communities who bear the least responsibility. The authors stopped short of suggesting specific policies to address that inequity, but the clear implication is that richer, more industrialized countries who are responsible for most of the climate pollution need to foot the bill to protect those on the front lines. The details of how that would work were the topic at last year's climate negotiations and will likely be a big focus again at this year's negotiations. Scientists hope this report will help leaders agree on a path forward.Rebecca Hersher, NPR News. ",Climate

Thoko Chikondi/AP hide caption, Residents in southern Malawi repair a home destroyed by heavy rain from Cyclone Freddy. Climate change is causing cyclones and hurricanes to get more intense and dangerous., The planet is on track for catastrophic warming, but world leaders already have many options to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and protect people, according to a major new climate change report from the United Nations., The report was drafted by top climate scientists and reviewed by delegates from nearly 200 countries. The authors hope it will provide crucial guidance to politicians around the world ahead of negotiations later this year aimed at reining in climate change., The planet faces an increasingly dire situation, according to the report. Climate change is already disrupting daily life around the world. Extreme weather, including heat waves, droughts, floods, wildfires and hurricanes, is killing and displacing people worldwide, and causing massive economic damage. And the amount of carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere is still rising., ""Climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health,"" the report states. ""There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all."", But there are many choices readily available to policymakers who want to address climate change, the report makes clear., Those choices include straightforward, immediate solutions such as quickly adopting renewable sources of electricity and clamping down on new oil and gas extraction. They are also more aspirational ones, such as investing in research that could one day allow technology to suck carbon dioxide out of the air., The authors of the report are not prescriptive. No solution is held up as the ""right"" one. Instead, scientists warn that there is no time, and no reason, to delay action on climate change. And every potential path forward includes reducing reliance on fossil fuels, the main driver of climate change., The report lays out sobering facts about the state of the Earth's climate., The planet is nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it was in the late 1800s, and is on track to exceed 5 degrees Fahrenheit of warming by the end of the century, it warns., That kind of extreme warming would spell disaster for billions of people, as well as critical ecosystems, and would lead to irreversible sea level rise and mass extinction of plants and animals., But it is still possible to change course, the report states. If humans can limit warming to no more than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius), some of the more catastrophic effects of climate change can be avoided. Sea levels would rise a lot less. Heat waves and storms would be less deadly. And many ecosystems on land and in the oceans would be more able to adapt or recover., To achieve that goal, global emissions would need to be slashed in half by the end of the decade, something the report authors say is still possible if countries around the world quickly pivot away from fossil fuels. Right now, total global emissions are not falling., , Over the last two years, hundreds of scientists working for the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have published three sprawling reports that highlighted the disproportionate effects of climate change on poor people, the need to cut emissions rapidly and the policy options available for doing so. Each of those documents ran hundreds of pages long., This latest report is the slim summary of all that work: a cheat-sheet for policymakers who face increasing pressure to address global warming., The timing of its publication coincides with an important deadline under the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to keep warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review their progress toward that goal at climate negotiations later this year in the United Arab Emirates., The hope is that the new report will serve as a shared scientific foundation for those negotiations, as well as a menu of solutions available to world leaders., ""When we talk about climate change it's often really easy to focus on the bad outcomes, the things that are really scary,"" says Solomon Hsiang, a climate scientist at the University of California, Berkeley who has worked with the IPCC., He says it's important that policymakers, and the wider public, not lose hope in the face of relentless news about extreme weather and other dangerous effects of global warming. Hsiang's own research has found that millions of lives, and billions of dollars, can be saved by reducing global reliance on fossil fuels, in part because extracting and burning fossil fuels releases enormous amounts of air and water pollution, on top of their damage to the climate., ""Investments in reducing emissions are investments in improving people's health and education and economic opportunities, and protecting the people we care about,"" he explains., The other big takeaway from the report is that people in developing countries, and poor people around the world, are disproportionately affected by climate change., ""Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected,"" the report states., For example, ""between 2010 and 2020, human mortality from floods, droughts and storms was 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions, compared to regions with very low vulnerability,"" the authors write., The most vulnerable communities include people who live in low-income countries, low-lying areas and island nations, and Indigenous groups around the world, according to the report., ""We are not all in this together,"" says Patricia Romero-Lankao, a climate researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the University of Chicago who works with the IPCC. ""The poorest and most marginalized communities are the most vulnerable, in all cities and in all regions."", Reducing emissions will help protect such communities, now and in the future, says Romero-Lankao., For example, investing in low-carbon public transit, designing communities to support walking or biking, building homes and other buildings to be resilient and building cleaner power plants can reduce air pollution and save lives in low-lying and low-income neighborhoods that are currently suffering disproportionate damage, the report notes., One of the biggest topics at international climate negotiations later this year will be how much richer, industrialized countries will pay to help poorer countries transition to clean energy and recover from damage caused by climate change. The industrialized world has historically been the biggest contributor of the pollution now driving climate change.",Climate

The memo boils down an issue to a single question and the president says yes or no. Today, the United Nations offers a kind of decision memo to leaders around the world on how to address climate change. Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate desk is here. Good morning. Good morning. OK, so what makes this memo a big deal? You know, there have been a lot of these, but this one is important. It's sort of where the rubber hits the road. So to understand why, we need to go back to the Paris Climate Agreement - that's from 2015. Remember, that agreement, it kicked off the current efforts by world leaders to cut climate pollution and to reduce how much fossil fuels we use. And the ultimate goal of that agreement was to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius. That's compared to the mid-1800s. That number, it came from one of these reports, one of these memos. Yeah, so later this year, there's this big international meeting coming to discuss the progress on meeting that goal. This report will be that sort of shared understanding for that meeting. So this is boiling down what people know about climate science and climate change so that leaders can make some kind of decision. Is that right? Yeah, exactly. And, you know, the key to this report is that it's extremely short. The idea is that it's so simple that world leaders might actually use it... (Laughter) And actually read it. ...Like a cheat sheet. OK. Good, good. Yeah. Amazing. So, for example, we expect that the report will have reminders that despite all of the Paris Agreement promises, global greenhouse gas emissions are not decreasing and that emissions need to fall by about half in the next decade. That's to avoid some really dangerous changes, like massive sea level rise and extinction of lots of animals and plants, which is really scary, obviously. Yeah. The report will also spell out all the ways that climate change is affecting people's lives right now - you know, more severe droughts and heavy rain and heat waves and disappearing ice - things that people see in their daily lives. And the U.S. has experienced both severe floods and severe drought in just the last few months. So that kind of extreme weather, we're seeing it in the headlines; it's happening around the world. What does the report say about what to do? Well, this is where the science has actually really matured. And you'll get my science geekery. It used to be that scientists were really focused on how global warming works, but now there's actually a lot of science about how to reduce emissions, you know, how to prepare for the changes that we know are coming, who is most vulnerable to climate change, social science, all different kinds of fields. So this report will focus on all of that work. So you can sort of think of it - going back to your decision memo metaphor - it's like a menu. It will lay out all the ways that we might reduce emissions. But there are things that are already happening - you know, renewable energy or changing the way we farm - but the menu will also include, like, more aspirational or theoretical ideas, like figuring out how to suck carbon out of the atmosphere - you know, technologies that don't yet exist, at least at scale. And the goal is to give policymakers reliable, broad-based information so they can take next steps. Look at the menu and say, I'll have the Impossible burger. (Laughter) Truly, the literally impossible burger. (Laughter) Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate desk. Thanks so much. Thanks.('S ""PASSACAGLIA"") ",Climate

ConocoPhillips via AP hide caption, This 2019 aerial photo provided by ConocoPhillips shows an exploratory drilling camp at the proposed site of the Willow oil project on Alaska's North Slope., The Biden administration has approved a massive new oil drilling project in Alaska, over the objections of environmental advocates who have said greenlighting the plan would violate the president's climate goals., It came a day after the administration said it was blocking or limiting drilling elsewhere in the state., The government on Monday approved a scaled-down version of the so-called Willow project, which means the energy firm ConocoPhillips can move ahead with its plans to drill in the National Petroleum Reserve, located on the state's North Slope. The company says the project has the potential to produce 180,000 barrels of oil per day., Proponents have suggested that the Willow project will lower oil prices and bolster national security, but Monday's announcement drew ire from environmental advocates who've called the proposal a ""carbon bomb"" and argue it could worsen climate change, harm biodiversity and slow a transition to cleaner fuels., ""We are too late in the climate crisis to approve massive oil and gas projects that directly undermine the new clean economy that the Biden Administration committed to advancing,"" Abigail Dillen, president of the group Earthjustice, said in a statement., The controversial project has become a galvanizing issue for young climate activists, and millions have sent letters to the White House arguing that the decision goes against the first-term Democrat's climate pledges., ""We know President Biden understands the existential threat of climate, but he is approving a project that derails his own climate goals,"" Dillen added., Within Alaska, the Willow project has enjoyed broad support from federal and state lawmakers, labor unions and Alaska Native leaders — many of whom have touted the potential for new jobs and increased revenue., ""We did it, Alaska!"" said Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who supported the project. ""What a huge and needed victory for all Alaska. This project will produce lasting economic and security benefits for our state and the nation."", The project will include more than 200 wells spread across three drilling pads and miles of pipelines and roads., Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive officer, applauded the Biden administration's approval., ""Willow fits within the Biden Administration's priorities on environmental and social justice, facilitating the energy transition and enhancing our energy security, all while creating good union jobs and providing benefits to Alaska Native communities,"" Lance said., ConocoPhillips said the project could generate as much as $17 billion in new revenue for federal, state and local governments. The company also said it would create 2,500 construction jobs and roughly 300 permanent jobs., The government's announcement on Sunday blocks drilling in roughly 3 million acres of the Beaufort Sea and restricts drilling in another 13 million acres of Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve., Environmental advocates said over the weekend that the tradeoff — allowing the massive Willow oil project to move forward while protecting up to 16 million acres of land in the Arctic — wasn't worth it., ""These unparalleled protections for Alaskan landscapes and waters are the right decision at the right time, and we thank the Biden Administration for taking this significant step,"" the Sierra Club's lands protection program director Athan Manuel said in a statement on Sunday., ""However, the benefits of these protections can be undone just as quickly by approval of oil and gas projects on public lands, and right now, no proposal poses a bigger threat to lands, wildlife, communities, and our climate than ConocoPhillips' Willow project,"" Manuel added., The Associated Press contributed reporting.",Climate

Mario Tama/Getty Images hide caption, Young giant sequoia trees are seen during a prescribed pile burning on Feb. 19 in Sequoia National Forest. Researchers say 20% of Sierra Nevada conifers are a mismatch with their climate., Some of the tall, stately trees that have grown up in California's Sierra Nevada are no longer compatible with the climate they live in, new research has shown., Hotter, drier conditions driven by climate change in the mountain range have made certain regions once hospitable to conifers — such as sequoia, ponderosa pine and Douglas fir — an environmental mismatch for the cone-bearing trees., ""They were exactly where we expected them to be, kind of along the lower-elevation, warmer and drier edges of the conifer forests in the Sierras,"" Avery Hill, who worked on the study as a graduate student at Stanford University, told NPR., Although there are conifers in those areas now, Hill and other researchers suggested that as the trees die out, they'll be replaced with other types of vegetation better suited to the environmental conditions., The team estimated that about 20% of all Sierra Nevada conifer trees in California are no longer compatible with the climate around them and are in danger of disappearing. They dubbed these trees ""zombie forests."", The team scrutinized vegetation data dating back to the 1930s, when all Sierra Nevada conifers were growing in appropriate climate conditions. Now, four out of five do., That change is largely due to higher temperatures and less rainfall in these lower-elevation areas, as well as human activities, such as logging, and an uptick in wildfires., The Sierra Nevada conifers aren't standing still. The average elevation of the trees has increased over the past 90 years, moving 112 feet upslope. According to Hill, that's because lower-elevation conifers have died while conifers at higher elevations where the air is cooler have been able to grow., But the conifers' uphill trek hasn't been able to keep pace with the dramatic increase in temperatures., The researchers said the number of Sierra Nevada conifers incompatible with their environments could double in the next 77 years., But Hill, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at the California Academy of Sciences, hopes that the maps he and his colleagues developed showing the state's ""zombie forests"" will help shape people's understanding of the effects of climate change., ""Conservationists know, scientists know, so many people know that ecosystems are changing and expect them to change more, and people are grappling with this,"" he said., ""These maps are unique, in that you can put your finger on a point and say, 'This area right here is expected to transition due to climate change in the near future,' and this forces some really difficult questions about what we want this land managed for and do we try to resist these impending changes,"" Hill added.",Climate

President Biden will prevent or limit oil drilling in 16 million acres of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean, an administration official said on Sunday. AP hide caption, This 2019 aerial photo provided by ConocoPhillips shows an exploratory drilling camp at the proposed site of the Willow oil project on Alaska's North Slope. President Biden will prevent or limit oil drilling in 16 million acres of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean, an administration official said on Sunday., WILMINGTON, Del. — As President Biden prepares a final decision on the huge Willow oil project in Alaska, his administration announced he will prevent or limit oil drilling in 16 million acres in Alaska and the Arctic Ocean., Plans announced Sunday night will bar drilling in nearly 3 million acres of the Beaufort Sea — closing it off from oil exploration — and limit drilling in more than 13 million acres in a vast swath of land known as the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska., The moves come as regulators prepare to announce a final decision on the $8 billion Willow project, a controversial oil drilling plan pushed by ConocoPhillips in the petroleum reserve. Climate activists have rallied against the project, calling it a ""carbon bomb"" that would be a betrayal of Biden's campaign pledges to curb new oil and gas drilling., Meanwhile, Alaska lawmakers, unions and indigenous communities have pressured Biden to approve the project, saying it would bring much-needed jobs and billions of dollars in taxes and mitigation funds to the vast, snow- and ice-covered region nearly 600 miles from Anchorage., Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, called Willow ""one of the biggest, most important resource development projects in our state's history."", Biden's decision on Willow will be one of his most consequential climate decisions and comes as he gears up for a likely reelection bid in 2024., A decision to approve Willow risks alienating young voters who have urged stronger climate action by the White House and flooded social media with demands to stop the Willow project. Approval also could spark protests similar to those against the failed Keystone XL oil pipeline during the Obama administration., Rejection of the project would meet strong resistance from Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, which met with top officials at the White House in recent days to lobby for the project. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who provided key support to confirm Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, said it was no secret she has cooperated with the White House on a range of issues., ""Cooperation goes both ways,"" she told reporters., Haaland, who fought the Willow project as a member of Congress, has the final decision on whether to approve it, although top White House climate officials are likely to be involved, with input from Biden himself. The White House said no final decision on Willow has been reached., Under the conservation plan announced Sunday, Biden will bar drilling in nearly 3 million acres of the Arctic Ocean, and impose new protections in the petroleum reserve., The withdrawal of the offshore area ensures that important habitat for whales, seals, polar bears and other wildlife ""will be protected in perpetuity from extractive development,'' the White House said in a statement., The action completes protections for the entire Beaufort Sea Planning Area, building upon then-President Obama's 2016 withdrawal of the Chukchi Sea Planning Area and the majority of the Beaufort Sea, the White House said., Separately, the administration moved to protect more than 13 million acres within the petroleum reserve, a 23-million acre chunk of land on Alaska's North Slope set aside a century ago for future oil production., The proposed Willow project is within the reserve, and ConocoPhillips has long held leases for the site. About half the reserve is off limits to oil and gas leasing under an Obama-era rule reinstated by the Biden administration last year., Areas to be protected include the Teshekpuk Lake, Utukok Uplands, Colville River, Kasegaluk Lagoon and Peard Bay Special Areas, collectively known for their globally significant habitat for grizzly and polar bears, caribou and hundreds of thousands of migratory birds., Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental group Earthjustice, welcomed the new conservation plan, but said if the Biden administration believes it has authority to limit oil development in the petroleum reserve, officials should extend those protections to the Willow site., ""They have the authority to block Willow,'' she said in an interview Sunday., Athan Manuel, director of the Sierra Club's lands protection program, said the benefits of the new protections would be more than undone by damage from Willow, which would be the biggest new oil field in decades in Alaska, producing up to 180,000 barrels per day, according to ConocoPhillips., ""No proposal poses a bigger threat to lands, wildlife, communities and our climate than ConocoPhillips' Willow project,'' Manuel said in a statement. ""Oil and gas leasing on public lands and waters must end — full stop. The eyes of the world are watching to see whether this administration will live up to its climate promises.'', In 2015, President Obama halted exploration in coastal areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, and he later withdrew most other potential Arctic Ocean lease areas — about 98% of the Arctic outer continental shelf. The bans were intended to protect polar bears, walruses, ice seals and Alaska Native villages that depend on the animals., President Trump reversed Obama's decision, but a federal judge restored the Obama-era restrictions in 2019, ruling that Trump exceeded his authority., The Biden administration received one bid in December for the right to drill offshore for oil and gas in Alaska's Cook Inlet.",Business

Let's focus in on one area along the central coast. That's where a levee broke on the Pajaro River in Monterey County. It's caused massive flooding. And we're joined now by Monterey County communications director Nick Pasculli. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. So give us the latest on this situation, you know, following this levee break. Yes, well, it's a very unfortunate situation that the levee broke on Friday, about midnight - just before midnight. And the extent of the breach is approximately 120ft wide, which immediately, when the levee broke, flooded the surrounding agricultural fields. I'd say within two hours, 2 1/2 hours, it actually made its way to the community of Pajaro, actually, right on the river at the border of the - northern border of Monterey County, adjacent to Santa Cruz County. And so there are about 1,700 people displaced from their homes in Pajaro.And the town is inundated with water throughout. And some areas are worse than others. But it's unfortunate. We have - we do have all those folks in shelters. Can you give us a sense of the communities affected? Many of these people are agricultural workers. Tell us about this community. The community of Pajaro is a very nice community. Yes, most of the folks that live there work in agriculture in one way or another. Also in the southern part of Monterey County, the community of San Ardo, which is largely an agricultural community, has been impacted by flooding with homes and businesses around the community of San Ardo. So you were on NPR just in January talking about flooding and evacuations. I know that this must feel relentless at this point. Yes, it does feel relentless, especially for the folks who are in these areas that are difficult to manage the water. I think what we're working on doing is we're providing as many services as we can to the folks that are affected by these - by this relentless flooding situation and rain situation. We have mental health professionals available in our shelters. We are 1,000% concerned about not just their physical health, but people's mental health. That is one of our biggest concerns, including our own disaster workers who, as you can probably appreciate, have been working 24 or 48 hours plus without sleep, without, you know, without getting enough food or seeing their families. It sounds like there's more rain coming. Like, what are the concerns looking ahead? I would imagine, especially in an agricultural community, having these floods is not good for the crops. So what are the concerns looking ahead? So, yes, there is more rain expected. You're correct. And the next big storm is predicted to come sometime Monday night into Tuesday. And then, of course, when we have these rains, as is typical of coastal communities in California, the higher elevations - because we are surrounded by mountains - does get a tremendous amount more rain than we do in the valleys. And it's interesting because people say, well, you only got a few inches, but yes, that might be true there maybe, you know, over time with ground saturation, but you also have water runoff coming from the mountains and the creeks that feed into these rivers. That's Nick Pasculli, communications director for Monterey County, Calif. Thank you so much for speaking with us. And thank you for having us. We're grateful. ",Climate

Desperation has turned to anger for many people in the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles. Residents there continue to dig out from the freak blizzard there two weeks ago, and they say the county isn't doing enough to help. From member station KVCR in San Bernardino, Madison Aument reports. Volunteers gather in a church parking lot at the base of the San Bernardino Mountains. The snow looks beautiful, but it's cut people off from vital supplies for weeks. This is our donation drop-off point. Rita Nelson has been organizing the relief. So people come, and companies and organizations come, and they're dropping off the food. And one way or another, we're getting it up to the mountain. Like many of the volunteers, Nelson evacuated before the blizzard and hasn't been able to get home. The county has plowed hundreds of miles of roads, but many are only wide enough for one car and are difficult to maneuver. Many smaller roads are still snowed in or walled off with 10-foot piles the plows left behind. While people can't leave their homes, what has made it out are pleas for help, which tugged at Nelson. I'm not going to just sit here and watch and hear all these stories on Facebook and people texting and calling out for help. And you can't ignore that. Some 25 volunteers who found each other via social media have jumped into action. In the church parking lot, a volunteer backs up a big delivery truck. Others load cases of bottled water, food, snow shovels and other supplies into the back. Folks are stranded out here. The driver heads to the San Bernardino Airport, where helicopters wait to fly the supplies up the mountain.(CROSSTALK) Inside a hangar, yet more volunteers weigh the donations to calibrate each helicopter's load. This part of the operation is run by the California Disaster Airlift Response Team, or CalDART. It's a nonprofit, all-volunteer group of pilots who fly their own helicopters. Our focus area today is SkyPark because the roads are worst in SkyPark. Paul Marshall is CalDART's president. They still can't get as easily into that area. The helicopters are a lot faster and more agile than trucks. Ron Lovick is an incident commander with CalDART. We can leave this airport, and we could be anywhere on that mountain in 15 minutes, and we can be right where it's needed. Like where Kevin Conners lives, in the small mountain town of Crestline - population about 9,000. He was able to crawl out of a window and trudge from his home to a grocery store. The store's roof had collapsed, but he was able to get food. There's no one that's ever walked up to my door or to our neighbor's doors. Conners feels like county officials have abandoned him. I know they say they're going door to door, but they haven't looked at this street ever. The frustration is understandable, says San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus. He's leading the storm response and says residents need to understand that in an emergency, there are priorities. We've got to find those folks that are truly in dire need. If you're worried about, you know, your driveway getting plowed, those things become secondary, even though we're making great strides as a county. San Bernardino has set up a hotline, food distribution sites and two shelters. Firefighters say they're going door to door to check for gas leaks. Meanwhile, CalDART volunteers plan to fly in supplies as long as they're needed.For NPR News, I'm Madison Aument in San Bernardino.('S ""MANDALA"") ",Climate

They say their ancestors come back through the plant. And the tradition marks the arrival of spring. The Northwest News Network's Anna King reports. Off a remote highway outside of Mission, Ore., a crew of women and girls gets ready to dig. So if we're all ready, we all need to line up. As they line up oldest to youngest, some faces are missing - mostly the elders who used to lead this gathering of wild celery. COVID hit the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation pretty hard. Now it's middle-aged women like Trish McMichael towards the front of the line. Are you guys all ready? They scramble up steep cliffs, sometimes using their hands as well as their feet. Woo, woo, woo. Turned it. Did you get one? Celery grows when there's still snow on the ground, the tops poking through between the rocks. It looks like small, curly parsley with a white stalk. Oh, you want to dig that up? The group digs them up with metal rods called kapins, gently moving the rocks back and forth to get at the plant.They're everywhere as I look down. They are, aren't they? We are very blessed this year. Very blessed. Trinette Minthorn has been coming to collect the celery since she was 6 years old. My dad's mother - she dug for a very long time until, you know, she couldn't, you know, get up the hills, and - but she would come. She would sit in the car and vehicle and watch us. And, you know, she was our cheerleader and our greatest supporter. Even though Minthorn is just 48 now, she took on much more responsibility after her grandmother's death. When she left us, it was hard, but, you know, we had to continue with the work, you know, because that's what, you know, she taught us. These women describe each plant as a family. The grandparents are the old dead stalks from years past. The parents are tall and green - the children? - tiny nubs. With climate change, the celery harvest is getting harder to predict, says Althea Wolf. She's here digging with her daughter. We used to eat the celery until about June, and it doesn't last that long anymore 'cause it's so dry. So when you have bits of snowpack around, that's really good for the celery because it helps it just continue to grow and grow. You don't get that anymore. The women don't taste the celery right away. They bite into it after a big ceremony back at the longhouse, when, they say, their ancestors and recent dead return through the plant to nourish them. Three-year-old Piips is here for her first ceremonial dig of Latit Latit - the wild celery - accompanied by her mother, Michelle Tias. Say, we're happy to feed the people. We're happy to feed the people. Latit Latit. Latit Latit. This joy makes her elders smile. Soon, Piips will be called to move up in the line. For NPR News, I'm Anna King outside of Mission, Ore.

AFP via Getty Images hide caption, A car hauler carrying Chrysler Pacificas' approaches the Ambassador Bridge that connects Windsor, Canada, to Detroit, Michigan,on October 5, 2018 in Windsor, Ontario, Canada., When most people think of Canada, they rarely think of cars. But the country, known for hockey, maple syrup and endless wilderness, is one of the largest car producers in North America. And with the growing importance of electric vehicles, Canada hopes to breathe new life into its automotive industry and maintain a more than 100-year-old tradition., Canada's automotive industry is primarily located in Ontario and Quebec, with Windsor, Ontario, claiming the title of Canada's automotive capital., ""We've been the auto capital of Canada since about 1904, when the first auto plant opened in Canada,"" said Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkins., Windsor, just across the river from Detroit, has benefited from its proximity to the United States and the three major carmakers headquartered there., Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler, and South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solutions (LGES) announced last year that they will invest more than 5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.5 billion) in building a new large-scale battery manufacturing plant in Windsor. The plant is expected to be operational by 2024 and will create an estimated 2,500 jobs., ""It's a massive, game-changing investment, and I'm not even sure these two words are big enough to describe how important it is for our community,"" Dilkins says. ""This will have a generational impact. [Companies] will look at the new world of automotive and will start looking at Windsor Essex as a place to do business., Investment by Stellantis and LGES is part of a larger trend that has seen more than CA$17 billion in announced investment in Ontario's automotive sector since the beginning of 2021., ""Ontario has had the greatest new investment in vehicle production in its history over the past two years,"" says Flavio Volpe, president of the Canadian Automobile Parts Manufacturers' Association., Most of this investment, worth nearly CA$13 billion, is in electric and battery production. And by passing the Inflation Reduction Act, U.S. lawmakers have given Canada a further boost to its EV ambitions., ""This is good news for Canadians, for our green economy, and for our growing EV manufacturing sector,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a tweet shortly after President Biden signed the law., The law includes tax credits for EV buyers, but only if the car is largely made and assembled in North America, and its battery uses locally mined components. According to GM Canada's David Paterson, this could give Canada an advantage over the U.S. and Mexico., General Motor's Canadian Technical Center at Oshawa is a vehicle development facility in Ontario, Canada. HJ Mai/NPR hide caption, General Motor's Canadian Technical Center at Oshawa is a vehicle development facility in Ontario, Canada., ""What goes into our [sic] batteries are cathode active materials, which are mainly made of nickel and other critical minerals that we happen to have in abundance here in Canada,"" he says., ""As we see less demand for gasoline, we see more demand for minerals, and Canada is an economy built on natural resources."", In an effort to encourage the shift in the auto industry toward battery-powered EVs, Canada's federal government along with Ontario's provincial government have been investing billions of dollars., ""Our incentive is that you have a job because we invest about $2.5 billion in taxpayer money in these [car companies,"" says Vic Fedeli, Ontario's Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade., The recent investment streak is a welcome sign for an industry that has gone through many ups and downs. Increased automation and competition from lower-wage regions have led to plant closures and job losses over the past two decades., ""We have been coming from a whole generation since about 2000, watching this critical sector decline. We have seen disinvestment in the sector, we have seen job losses in the sector, we have seen plants closed and communities are basically disappearing,"" says Angelo DiCaro, research director for Unifor, a union representing about 230,000 Canadian auto workers., The North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA for short, contributed to this downturn as car companies moved their assembly lines to places like Mexico or the U.S. Southeast to cut costs. The USMAC, which replaced NAFTA in 2020, has somewhat leveled the playing field by boosting regional content requirements and instituting a minimum wage of at least $16 an hour., DiCaro says that despite the uncertainty surrounding certain jobs that could be lost in this transition to electric vehicles, Canada's auto workers have a sense of optimism and hope., According to government data, the auto sector plays a key role in Canada's economy, contributing CA$16 billion to its gross domestic product (GDP). With nearly 500,000 direct or indirect jobs, automotive is one of the country's largest manufacturing sectors and one of its largest export industries., Volkswagen and its battery company PowerCo announced Monday that they selected Ontario, Canada as the location of Volkswagen's first cell manufacturing facility in North America., The new battery plant in Canada will be the third group in the group, after Salzgitter, Germany and Valencia, Spain., ""Canada offers ideal conditions, including the local supply of raw materials and wide access to clean electricity,"" the group said in a press release., Production is expected to start in 2027., Tesla is another company that publicly stated it is actively looking at Canada as a potential site for a new battery and / or assembly plant. The company would join Ford, General Motors, Honda, Stellantis and Toyota, which already have production facilities in Ontario., ""The success of the [Ontario] government and the federal government [sic] will not be defined by what we have landed at the moment. It will be whether we can lend a sixth automaker or a seventh,"" Flavio Volpe says. ""It will mean that our vision was worthy of the rhetoric and convince the best automakers in the world that the future runs through Ontario.""",Business

That's because of what meteorologists called atmospheric rivers. These are plumes of tropical moisture that dump large amounts of rain, and they've been pummeling parts of the state. In Northern California, some areas have even been experiencing snowfall. Humboldt County recently declared a state of emergency due to the storms.We wanted to learn more about how all this is affecting residents, so we've called Humboldt County Sheriff William Honsal, who declared a local state of emergency earlier this week, and he is with us now. Sheriff, thank you so much for being here. Thanks, Michel. It's good to be on your program. So you've been sheriff for six years. You were born and raised in the area. Have you ever seen anything like this? I have not. This is an unprecedented storm system that has really caused a lot of havoc in our county. Talk a little bit about what you're seeing and experiencing there. So if you're not familiar with Humboldt County, we're in the northwest corner of the state. It is really geographically diverse. We got the ocean. We got the redwoods, the tallest trees in the world. And we have a sparse population. It's a county the size of Connecticut, but we only have 135,000 people. We have two major highways going through it. And so when this storm came in, you know, we're initially going to count for maybe one or two feet of snow. We got eight feet up in our mountains and our hills. This is what you said in the - in declaring this a local state of emergency. And you're pretty clear about it. In the announcement, you wrote - or your office wrote, consecutive major winter storms have resulted in a large accumulation of snow, impassable roadways, downed trees, disrupted utility services, damaged and flooded roadways, mudslides, damaged structures and dead livestock, these impacts exhausting and exceeding available county resources. So pretty clear. Yes Absolutely. What - does that mean that there are people you can't get to? Like, can you communicate with residents? Like, if they need help, do they even have a way to tell you? So sometimes, they don't. Like, we're experiencing a case today - actually, it started yesterday, where we got a call that there's a residence in a certain part of our county that is isolated. They have - their loved ones haven't heard from them in days. The power service in that area is cut off, so the cell signals are cut off. These people live off the grid. And so we spent the better part of all yesterday basically using our tracked Sno-Cat vehicle, you know, trying to access this person's roadway.They live five miles in. We're only able to get three miles yesterday because of all the downed trees and the heavy snow. So we're calling in bulldozers. We're calling in more resources. They're trying - and get to these people because we really don't know. And the scary thing is, you know, there may be further casualties we're going to find in the coming days when the snow does melt and people can get to their loved ones because, you know, with the accumulation of snow and now the rain, it is going to cause some structure failures and some roof collapses. So before I let you go, sheriff, do you mind if I ask, how are you? Humboldt County is really unique. This is the third state of emergency we've gone through over the last three months. We've had our major earthquake in December. We had severe winter weather storms, strong winds, mudslides in January and now this February, March, winter storm. There hasn't been a time where we've declared, you know, three local emergencies and then, ratified by the state, state emergencies in a period of three months. So we're rattled, to be honest.And, you know, there's a lot of our guys that just have worked for weeks on end with no time off. And we're tired, essentially. And our Office of Emergency Services is still recovering from the pandemic. But I'm thankful I have great people that work with me. I have an awesome team. And like I said, it's all about the relationships. Our fire departments, our state office of emergency services, the federal resources have really come together, and I'm really thankful for the teamwork that we can provide, you know, the services to our residents here. That was William Honsal. He's the sheriff for Humboldt County, Calif. He manages emergency services for the county there. Sheriff, thank you so much for joining us. My best wishes to you and to your team and all the people you're trying to take care of. Michel, I really appreciate it. I hope you have a good weekend. ",Climate

Heavy rain - as much as 10 inches - is compounding the effects of the several atmospheric rivers that hit the state earlier this year. Mudslides are forcing road closures. Some towns have been evacuated. Member station KCRW's Matt Guilhem joins us now from Santa Barbara. Matt, thanks for being with us. Thanks for having me. Give us some idea of what's happening there, please. Well, in Southern California, where I am, we're getting off pretty easy. Compared to some of the other storms that have come through this season, this one has been pretty mild, but that's what forecasters predicted. It's a different story as you move up the state. In Kern County, which is north of LA, areas surrounding the Kern River have been evacuated due to flooding. I'll let National Weather Service meteorologist Antoinette Serrato explain what caused the river to jump its banks. This warm rain came into the area and in places that had low-elevation snow, that low-elevation snow isn't supported by a very stable, thick snowpack. And so what really happened is that that rain melted the snow and created rain-on-snow runoff. It's a similar story for other rivers as well. Many are running above flood stage. And in Santa Cruz County, flooding has triggered mudslides and washed-out roads. And this is rain, not snow like some of the storms that hit earlier this year. That's right. Like earlier storms, this one is an atmospheric river, meaning it's like a conveyor belt for moisture, channeling water vapor from hundreds of miles away right into the Golden State. But those were cold storms bringing snow, as you say. This time we're getting hit with a so-called pineapple express. It's a warmer storm, and it's hitting many parts of northern and central California with more rain than snow even at higher elevations. Matt, this is quite a contrast with California, which is usually under drought warnings. Are officials doing anything to try and capture all this water that's suddenly soaking the state? Yes, Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order yesterday that cuts some of the red tape surrounding water storage. Along with that order from the governor, he's declared states of emergency tied to recent storms in a majority of California's counties. And just yesterday, President Biden authorized an emergency declaration for the state. The regional FEMA director, Robert Fenton, says... That allows FEMA to direct other federal agencies to provide lifesaving and emergency assistance as needed to respond to not only the current events happening right now, but the other atmospheric rivers as they come. If there's any silver lining to all of this, the series of storms has worked wonders for our drought. At the start of the year, 35% of the state was experiencing the U.S. Drought Monitor's most severe conditions. Today we are completely out of those categories and a quarter of the state isn't experiencing any drought. Matt, what indications are about when the storm system might move out? Short term, this system should clear out by tomorrow. But another atmospheric river is on its way early next week, so not a lot of time to absorb all this water before we get soaked again. Reporter Matt Guilhem of member station KCRW. Thanks very much for being with us, Matt. Happy to do it. ",Climate

Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption, A part of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System is seen in Fairbanks, Alaska in September 2019. Environmentalists say a proposed new drilling project, the Willow Master Development Plan, would disturb Alaska's critical wildlife habitat with more surface-level oil infrastructure., Any day now, the Biden administration is expected to decide whether to approve a controversial oil drilling project that's become a galvanizing issue for Gen Zers passionate about climate change. They've taken their message to platforms like TikTok, amassing top views on videos outlining the issue. They've also sent millions of letters to the White House., Supporters of the so-called Willow Project say drilling in Arctic Alaska will lower oil prices and boost national security. But its opponents say it comes with unacceptable environmental consequences and disincentivize a transition to cleaner fuels., That leaves the Biden administration stuck in the crosscurrents of its own conflicting priorities — and Gen Zers are prepared to read the decision as a clarification on where the country's political power lies., Here's an overview of where things stand., The Willow Master Development Plan is a $6 billion proposal from ConocoPhillips to drill oil inside the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska., The oil giant says the project could deliver up to $17 billion in revenue for federal, state and local governments, creating over 2,800 jobs., Willow would also yield an estimated 600 million barrels of oil, a volume nearly 1.5 times the current supply in the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Biden administration says boosting oil production could help keep consumer energy prices down — a statement that economists caveat, saying it'd take years to actually see prices drop., Willow's proposed development would unfold on the North Slope of the petroleum reserve, a 23 million-acre region that represents the largest undisturbed public land in the U.S., The Bureau of Land Management describes the proposed site as ""critical"" to local wildlife, supporting ""thousands of migratory birds"" and serving as ""a primary calving area"" for local caribou. Beyond the region, the BLM says the project would release 9.2 million metric tons of annual carbon pollution, which contributes to human-caused climate change. That's equivalent to the emissions of roughly 2 million gas-powered cars., US President Joe Biden greets Department of the Interior Secretary Deb Haaland during the White House Tribal Nations Summit this November. Haaland ultimately has the final say on how, if at all, the Willow Project can advance. Pete Marovich/Getty Images hide caption, US President Joe Biden greets Department of the Interior Secretary Deb Haaland during the White House Tribal Nations Summit this November. Haaland ultimately has the final say on how, if at all, the Willow Project can advance., The Trump administration initially approved the Willow Project in late 2020, but a federal judge vacated development permits, saying initial federal reviews failed to include measures to mitigate the impact on polar bears., On Feb. 1, the BLM published a new environmental impact analysis of the plan, proposing one fewer drilling sites and less surface infrastructure such as roads and pipelines. ConocoPhillips called it ""a practical way forward""., Ultimately, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland formally gets the final say. She could approve the original ConocoPhillips plan, greenlight the BLM's revised plan, halt the project altogether or take any action in between., The Interior Department initially said that the revised plan still left substantial concerns about Willow's impact on greenhouse gas emissions., But halting Willow would put the Biden administration in a tricky political position. The president made a campaign promise not to start any new drilling on federal lands — but, in office, he's prioritized lowering energy prices amid uncertainty in the global oil market., But more than four days have passed since the end of a formal 30-day review period on the BLM plan, the date many observers had been expecting a decision., On Friday morning, the Interior Department told NPR it had no update on the timing of a decision. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed during Friday's press briefing that the president had met with the Alaskan congressional delegation about the project last week but that the decision would ultimately come from the Interior Department., As the wait drags on, the debate only grows louder., On Wednesday, Alaska's congressional delegation urged swift approval for the BLM plan, citing, above all else, the need for economic relief., ""We all recognize the need for cleaner energy, but there is a major gap between our capability to generate it and our daily needs,"" wrote the two Republican Senators and one Democratic representative in an opinion piece for CNN., ""Even those who practice a subsistence lifestyle in Alaska — living primarily off the land and water — rely on boats, snowmachines and ATVs, and those all need fuel. In rural parts of our state, gasoline prices have been as high as $18 a gallon."", Native Alaskan leaders themselves are split on whether the project will be a positive impact to the community. Leaders for Voice of the Arctic, a coalition of Inupiat North Slope leaders, says yes: The estimated $1 billion in taxes alone would fund critical education, police and firefighting improvements., But leaders of the City of Nuiqsut and Native Village of Nuiqsut, the residential areas sitting closest to the proposed development site, said in their own scathing letter that their input hadn't been heard., ""It seems that despite its nod to traditional ecological knowledge, BLM does not consider relevant the extensive knowledge and expertise we have gained over millennia, living in a way that is so deeply connected to our environment,"" they wrote directly to Haaland., Opposition to the project has spread so far and fast on social media. TikTokkers say the decentralized nature of the issue is well suited to the platform: It's popular because there's no unified message or group dominating the conversation., ""This is an economic issue, an environmental issue and a social issue,"" explained Alex Haraus, a 25-year-old environmentalist whose videos on the Willow Project have been viewed millions of times., ""A lot of times in the past, we've seen groups take a stance on one thing and say that's why everyone should care. But in this case, we've really just said, 'here are all of the reasons why you should care. Pick whatever you're passionate about and talk about it in your own way,'"" Haraus said., The formula worked. Hashtags like #willowproject, #stopwillow and #stopthewillowproject have appeared in TikTok's daily top 10 lists, beating out hot celebrity feuds and universal trends like #springbreak. Posts tagged with #willowproject have attracted over 88 million U.S. views in the last month alone., As of Friday, a change.org petition calling for an end to the project had amassed more than 3.1 million signatures, and a letter-writing form hosted by the advocacy group Protect the Arctic has tracked over 1.1 million unique letters to the White House., Elise Joshi, a 20-year-old climate activist who's been posting environmental content for the last two years, says she hasn't seen this much interest in a climate issue ""in a long time, maybe ever."", Joshi says the 30-day review window for the project lent an omnipresent, slow-moving emergency (climate change) a tangible deadline. But just as urgent, Joshi says, is the feeling that the Biden administration could betray the very people who put the president in power., ""I hope the administration sees the same people who we worked with on climate legislation are rallying against [Project Willow],"" she said, adding that she was among the activists invited to the White House signing of the Inflation Reduction Act., ""This isn't the Trump administration. This is someone we voted for,"" she added., Neither Joshi nor Haraus sees the decision on the Willow Project as the end to Gen Zers' interest in stopping oil drilling. But if successful, #StopWillow could serve as a key argument for how digital attention is remaking the landscape of political power., ""If this doesn't represent an issue that's resonating with general Americans, then I don't know what does,"" Haraus said.",National
https://www.npr.org/2023/03/10/1162511128/morning-news-brief,2023-03-10,Morning news brief,"Steve Inskeep, A Martínez","Just how hot is the U.S. job market? In January, employers added more than half a million jobs, we're told. The unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in more than half a century. But a single month's numbers can be wrong or a fluke, so we get some context today when the Labor Department offers another month's worth of numbers.MARTÍ Here's NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, so what do we expect to see in today's jobs report? Good morning, A. Forecasters think hiring probably slowed last month, but of course, that's what they were expecting in January, too. And instead, we got the strongest job growth in six months. And it wasn't just that strong jobs report that got people's attention in January. There was also a big jump in spending that month as people opened their pocketbooks at restaurants and department stores and auto showrooms, and inflation, which had been trending down, picked up a little steam as well. So all that set off some alarm bells for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues. They thought they were making good progress in getting inflation under control. But Powell told lawmakers this week that if economic indicators keep coming in hot like that, the Fed may have to hit the brakes harder by raising interest rates even faster than they have been. If - and I stress that no decision has been made on this, but if the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we'd be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes. Now, the Fed's next rate-setting meeting is coming up in less than two weeks, and the strength of today's jobs report will be a big factor in whether they raise rates by a quarter point like they did last month or move more aggressively with a half-point interest rate hike.MARTÍ Yesterday General Motors said it's offering buyouts to most of its white-collar workers. That's just one of a few big companies that's cutting jobs. Scott, how does that square with these really strong jobs numbers? Yeah, there have been a lot of headlines about layoffs, especially in the tech sector and also with some manufacturing firms. So far, though, this isn't making much of a dent in the overall jobs data. You know, unemployment remains super low, and that's one reason the Fed feels like it has some latitude to move aggressively against inflation. Powell did get some pushback this week from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. She notes that an informal forecast by Fed officials back in December showed unemployment climbing to 4.6% this year. Now, that would still be quite low by historical standards, but it does imply a loss of about 2 million jobs. Here's Powell's rather testy exchange with the senator. Right now, the unemployment rate is 3.4%, which is the lowest in 54 years. And we actually don't think that we need to see a sharp or enormous increase in unemployment to get inflation under control. I'm looking at your projections. Do you call two - laying off 2 million people this year not a sharp increase in unemployment? I would say 4 1/2%... Explain that to the 2 million families who are going to be out of work. Now, Powell insists the Fed is not trying to put anybody out of work. He also adds working people are getting hurt right now by high inflation.MARTÍ So what sectors then might feel the pinch of the slowdown the most? The housing market is very sensitive to rising interest rates. Mortgage rates jumped again this week to nearly 6 3/4%. So that's going to likely weigh on construction workers and realtors and mortgage brokers. Factories are also feeling some pressure. But, you know, the services sector continues to expand, and that's a big share of what people spend money on, and it's also a big share of the workforce.MARTÍ NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks. You're welcome.MARTÍ The leader of the European Union visits President Biden today. Ursula von der Leyen is president of the European Commission, which is the name for their executive branch. She's done this job for more than three years through the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. And when she meets President Biden today, she is representing the interests of dozens of countries, including France, Italy and her own nation, Germany.MARTÍ And she's likely to tell President Biden the U.S. is unfair to European companies that make green technology. NPR's Rob Schmitz joins us now from Berlin. Rob, what's she worried about? Yeah, she's worried that the Inflation Reduction Act of the United States is a protectionist act. This is also called the IRA, and it promises tax breaks to companies making technology for clean energy, but only if their operations are located on U.S. soil. And European leaders are really concerned that EU companies will flee Europe to cash in on these tax breaks. Many here feel that the EU economy could be at stake here. When the IRA passed into law, Volkswagen, for example, announced that it put plans for a battery plant in Eastern Europe on hold because the company said it suddenly stood to save more than $10 billion by moving that plant and with it hundreds of jobs to the U.S. Since then, it's been waiting for the EU to come forth with a rival deal so that it can weigh its options. But Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, says he's skeptical about that. To be quite honest, I have big doubts that companies like Volkswagen really seriously consider moving certain plants from Europe to the U.S. And what I currently see is a bit of a blackmail. So companies in Europe say, you know, let's see what the Europeans are willing to match, how much money we can get in addition. And that's a very dangerous game. And, A, Fratzscher says it's dangerous because these companies are trying to squeeze billions of dollars out of an already cash-strapped EU. And when the EU loses money like this, it has less money to help incentivize carbon-saving climate goals. So in the end, he says, the environment loses, and big multinationals win.MARTÍ So then that's got to be why von der Leyen is in Washington. Yeah, she's trying to negotiate changes to the IRA that wouldn't lead to an exodus of European companies to the U.S. to cash in on these incentives. And here in Germany, this is a real threat to the economy. An internal report compiled by the EU and leaked to German media shows that 1 in 4 companies in German industry is considering leaving the country. We also know that multinationals like BASF and BMW are considering leaving, too, because of high energy costs.MARTÍ Then how realistic do you think it is for von der Leyen to convince President Biden to accommodate the EU and then stop that exodus from even happening? Yeah, it does seem possible. A senior White House official speaking on background says that the U.S. wants to make sure that incentives under the IRA and EU incentives for clean energy will not be competing with one another in the sort of zero-sum way. If that happened, this official said it would impact jobs on both sides of the Atlantic and would instead create windfalls for private interests. So it appears that the Biden administration is open to the EU's concerns and would prefer to have a partnership so that the U.S. and the EU can instead work together to reduce their dependence on China, which controls many of the rare earth metals that are needed for this clean energy transition. And this will also be high on the agenda in today's meeting.MARTÍ All right. We're going to hear more about that later today. That's NPR's Rob Schmitz, joining us from Berlin. Rob, thanks. Thank you.MARTÍ All right. California's run of intense winter weather is not over. Hope you're ready, A.MARTÍ I have to be. Yeah. The first of two atmospheric rivers is hitting the state today. Somewhere over the head of A Martínez, there's a high risk of flooding and landslides and avalanches. And Governor Gavin Newsom wants President Biden to declare an emergency and release federal aid.MARTÍ NPR's Nathan Rott is in Southern California. Nathan, before I drove in to NPR West, the skies looked like they were about to tear open at any moment. It looks like it could be a pretty big storm. Yeah, it definitely is. You know, we're talking about forecasts of more than a hundred inches of snow at some mountain passes in the Sierra Nevada, upwards of 10 inches of rain in some parts of central California. It'll be a little tamer down here in Southern California, but millions of people were put under flood watches Thursday in anticipation of this atmospheric river that's expected to really hit home today, atmospheric rivers being essentially giant conveyor belts of moisture that cart water from the tropics to places like California. This one is carrying water from near Hawaii. And what's unique about this storm and concerning is that it's expected to bring rain to areas that have already been inundated with snow.MARTÍ Yeah, there are some mountain communities that are still trying to dig themselves out. Yeah, that's right - I mean, places like Big Bear, not far from where both of us are, which has been dealing with blocked roads and power outages from that deep snow, you know, but even more so in central parts of the state. You know, the concern there is, A, that rain could fall at pretty high elevations onto some of these places that already are buried in snow. And so the problem that that could cause is this rain could be absorbed by the snow. And as any experienced driveway shoveler knows, wet snow is a heck of a lot heavier than dry, so it could add extra stress to structures that are still buried or trigger avalanches. The other problem is potential runoff. Rain and warmer temperatures could help melt more of the snow, adding to these flood concerns. Here's Karla Nemeth, the director of California's Department of Water Resources, at a briefing yesterday. Rivers and creeks can rise very quickly, and so it does have the potential to be a dangerous situation, particularly in areas that had experienced flooding before. Which, if you remember, A, is a whole lot of California, as we've been seeing this year.MARTÍ Yeah. So what are officials trying to do to lower those risks? So they're urging everyone who's experienced flooding this year, particularly those who live near a river or creek, to be ready to go, right? The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and California's Department of Water Resources have been strategically releasing water from reservoirs so that they can handle all of this incoming runoff, which is a kind of wild thing if you stop and think about it, because just last year, nearly all of California was in some state of drought, so letting go of water would have seemed unthinkable.MARTÍ All right, so you mentioned the D-word, Nate. Anytime it rains in California, people want to know, is the drought over? I'm sorry, A. It is not. Groundwater reservoirs in much of California are still very much depleted. You know, remember, people sucked so much water out of the earth in some parts of California during the heart of the drought that the ground actually sank. More broadly, though, if we step back, the megadrought plaguing California is also impacting much of the western U.S., and California depends on a lot of water from that broader region. So the good news is many parts of the West are seeing a wet year. Skiers are having a heyday. But this drought has brought to light some bigger fundamental issues about water in the Western U.S., the way that it's used, the way that it's allocated - issues like the whole system being predicated on a presumption that there's more water available than there normally is. And even a really wet winter like we're experiencing right now - it does not address all of those concerns.MARTÍ That's NPR's Nathan Rott, reporting from Southern California. Nathan, stay dry. You as well, A. ",Climate

It finds that toothed whales can make a range of vocalizations, including some akin to human 'vocal fry,' thanks to a special nasal structure., Reading the science headlines this week, we have of questions. Why are more animals than just humans saddled — er, blessed — with vocal fry? Why should we care if 8 million year old plankton fossils are in different locations than plankton living today? And is humanity finally united on protecting the Earth's seas with the creation of the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction treaty?, Luckily, it's the job of the Short Wave team to decipher the science behind the headlines. This week, that deciphering comes from co-hosts Emily Kwong and Aaron Scott, with the help of NPR climate correspondent Lauren Sommer. Hang out with us as we dish on some of the coolest science stories in this ocean-themed installment of our regular newsy get-togethers!, This week, Lauren spoke to micro-paleontologist Adam Woodhouse, a post-doc at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics. He studies the plankton the size of a grain of sand, called Foraminifera. When they die, they sink to the ocean floor and form layers of microfossils. In a recent study published in Nature, Adam and his colleagues found that 8 million years ago, when the oceans were warmer, those plankton were in very different places from where they are today — about 2,000 miles away, closer to the poles. Plankton are at the base of the food web. Where plankton migrate as waters warm, so too will the entire food web, including the fish and marine life people depend on., For decades, researchers have been stumped trying to understand how toothed whales — like dolphins, sperm whales, and pilot whales — produce such a wide range of sounds. Hunting dozens of meters below the ocean's surface, their lungs are compressed. So, how are they able to echolocate their prey and navigate their murky surroundings? According to new research published in Sciencelast week, the secret to toothed whales' vocal repertoire is found in their phonic lips. Located inside their nose, the phonic lips produce sound waves with very little air. Moreover, these researchers found that toothed whales are using their vocal fry register — a lower register than usual — to echolocate and hunt prey., Read more reporting on this topic from our colleague Ari Daniel., About half of the planet is covered by international waters that are largely unregulated — especially when it comes to the environmental protections. For two decades, countries have been negotiating to create a treaty to protect these waters beyond individual countries' control. March 4, United Nations member states finally accomplished that goal and released the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction treaty. It's a legal framework that allows countries to create marine protected areas in the ocean, wherein activities like fishing, mining or drilling can be restricted. The treaty also sets ground rules for how countries assess the environmental impact of various marine activities and sets up a way to share the benefits and profits from any sort of genetic resources that are discovered. It's a great first step toward protecting our oceans, but there's still work to be done. Countries have to adopt and then ratify the treaty. And there's still the question of how to concretely manage and enforce the protected areas., Have suggestions for what we should cover in our next news roundup?

One of the most consequential shifts involve some of the smallest living things on the planet. Lauren Sommer from NPR's climate desk has more. A paleontologist is a scientist who studies fossils. Adam Woodhouse is a micropaleontologist. So when people hear that, they ask him... Oh, is that like tiny dinosaurs? It's not tiny dinosaurs. As a postdoc at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, he studies plankton - a kind called Foraminifera. They're about the size of a grain of sand. They just float around in the ocean. And when they die, their tiny shells fall to the ocean floor and become microfossils. Over time, there are layers of them that build up, and the layers tell a story. So you just kind of have pages of the book of life. The more sediment you dig up, the more kind of pages you're opening as you go down. In a study in the journal Nature, Woodhouse and his colleagues found that 8 million years ago, when the oceans were warmer, plankton were in different places. They were closer to the poles - about 2,000 miles from where they are now. And that matters because with climate change, we're heating up the oceans again. So the question is... Are those plankton going to move back to where they were, 2,000 miles away from the equator, again? Why care if plankton are moving? They're the base of the food chain. So where they are, you'll also find... Tuna, billfish, krill and squid. And these organisms, of course, provide sustenance and the livelihood to billions of people around the globe. Scientists are already seeing this plankton shift. Charlie Stock, a research oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says in the past, plankton had millennia to adjust to changing oceans. The key difference is the pace of that change. You know, with anthropogenic climate change, we're talking about looking at changes that are introduced rapidly over a century time scale. And when plankton and fish move, entire fisheries could shift from one state or country to another. And that's certainly an issue that's already causing friction internationally and nationally. It's why climate change is making protecting the ocean even harder. Predicting those changes could help, and that means closely tracking its tiniest planktonic creatures.Lauren Sommer, NPR News.

With annual average temperatures in Montana rising, the whitebark pine that were not previously threatened are now facing an increase in blister rust infections, mountain pine beetle infestations and wildfire., Stretching from British Columbia, Canada down to parts of California and east to Montana, live the whitebark pine. The tree grows in subalpine and timberline zones — elevations anywhere from 4,000 to almost 9,000 ft. It's an unforgiving space. The wind is harsh. Plants and animals confront sub-freezing temperatures, often until summertime., The whitebark pine has historically thrived in these lands., But today, the tree species is in trouble. So much so that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the whitebark pine as a threatened species in December 2022. Increased fire intensity from climate change and colonial fire suppression practices, infestation by mountain pine beetles and a deadly fungus called blister rust — they're collectively killing this tree., Losing whitebark pine on the landscape does not mean just losing one type of tree. It's a keystone species, meaning it has a large, outsized impact on its ecosystem. The tree provides habitat to small animals, shelter for larger ones and food for local fauna like birds and bears. Historically, the seeds have been a first food for local Indigenous peoples such as the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. The tree also provides shade, slowing glacial melt that would otherwise flood the valleys below., Researchers like ShiNaasha Pete are working to restore the tree.

Kamran Jebreili/AP hide caption, Sultan al-Jaber, the CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., talks during the World Government Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Feb 14, 2023., A top oil company CEO who will lead international climate talks later this year told energy industry power players on Monday that the world must cut emissions 7% each year and eliminate all releases of the greenhouse gas methane — strong comments from an oil executive., ""Let me call on you to decarbonize quicker,"" Sultan al-Jaber, CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., said at the Ceraweek conference, held in Houston., But al-Jabar did not directly address emissions from transportation, where most crude oil ends up. Emissions from transport are the largest contributor to climate change in many countries, including the United States., Al-Jaber singled out electricity, cement, steel and aluminum as targets for cleanup, but not trucks, cars, trains and aircraft. He called for far greater investment to speed the transition to cleaner industries., ""According to the IEA, in 2022, the world invested $1.4 trillion in the energy transition,"" he said. ""We need over three times that amount."", And that investment, he said, must flow to the developing world., ""Only 15% of clean tech investment reaches developing economies in the global south, and that is where 80% of the population live,"" he stressed., Al-Jaber did not call for the phasing out of oil and gas production and use, something that scientists and advocates have been demanding unsuccessfully over repeated COPs, short for Conference of the Parties, where nations meet to make climate commitments., According to the International Energy Agency, to avoid the worst climate changes, there must be no new oil and gas infrastructure built out., The United Arab Emirates leader said his country was first in its region to commit to the Paris climate agreement, and to set a pathway to net zero emissions. But its emissions in 2021 were up 3%, not down, from the year before, according to the Global Carbon Project. They were however 6% below the country's peak in 2015. According to Climate Action Tracker, UAE has an overall rating of ""highly insufficient,"" meaning its projected emissions are not in line with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius., The Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. pumps approximately 4 million barrels of crude a day and plans on expanding to 5 million barrels daily., Each year, nations gather at the COP to discuss how Paris Agreement goals to limit global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2050, can be achieved through international collaboration., The 28th such conference, COP28, will be held in Dubai, Nov 30 to Dec. 12. The choice of country has drawn criticism given the nation's high, and growing level of crude production. The choice of al Jaber, CEO of the national oil company, has also drawn scorn. However, U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry has said he backs the UAE leader., As president of this year's meeting, al-Jaber will have influence over how much pressure is brought to bear on those most reponsible for climate change, countries and companies that produce and burn coal, oil and gas., Al-Jaber is the UAE minister of industry and advanced technology, and also serves as the chairman of Masdar, a renewable energy company.Ceraweek attracts high level oil and gas officials each year and is hosted by S&P Global.",Climate

It's the equivalent of about two new coal plants per week. That's according to a new report out. To find out more, we turn to reporter Julia Simon from NPR's climate desk. Hi, Julia. Good morning, Leila. So this is a massive increase in new coal plant approvals in China. What's driving it? Yeah. The researchers found this really accelerated in the second half of last year. Last summer, there were these big heat waves in China. And there's an ongoing drought in China. The Yangtze River dried up in places. So you had millions of people running their A/Cs in the heat and not enough hydropower. China's provincial governments worried about blackouts and quickly broke ground on new coal plants. So they need more electricity. Now, China leads the world in building new renewables. So why are they turning to coal-fired power plants for this? Well, they're doing both. They're building more solar and wind than any other country and building new coal plants. Some of these provinces say that they'll only run the new coal plants as backup for renewables. It's too early to know how much they'll run. Report co-author Aiqun Yu of Global Energy Monitor says a lot of why China turned to coal last year comes from the country's coal lobby. For a long time, the industry tried to just spread the words that coal is the most reliable energy type. So when the energy crisis happened, the country just seeks solutions from coal by default - immediate reaction, just go to coal. And, Leila, that's despite the fact that coal just isn't that economical anymore, especially compared to renewables. And many of these new coal plants might end up losing money. Now, China is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. So what do new coal plants there mean for reaching climate goals? It's still unclear. China has committed to having its emissions peak before 2030. What they didn't say is how high that peak would get. The higher the peak, the harder it is to get off fossil fuels. Globally, coal use is expected to peak soon. It's just no longer economical again. And it's harder to get financing for new coal plants. China really is seeming like the exception as it builds all these plants. So are there ways to turn more to renewables than coal for China? Yeah. So one big solution here involves the Chinese grid. In the U.S., we have these bottlenecks and delays for getting renewables onto the grid, problem with transmission between regions. Those are some of the same issues they're having in China. So researchers say working on technical and political grid issues can help China get more renewables and storage online. NPR's climate solutions reporter Julia Simon, thanks so much. Thank you, Leila.('S """") ",Climate

And if you do, you'd better savor it., Supermarkets like Tesco and Aldi have placed strict limits on the number of tomatoes customers can buy, as well as other produce, like cucumbers and broccoli., Economist Tim Harford, host of the podcast Cautionary Tales, serves tomatoes to his family a lot., So when he heard the news about shortages, he rushed to the local Tesco., ""There's this whole shelf that normally has crates and crates of different kinds of tomatoes,"" he recalls. ""And there were just three packs left."", Limit per customer: one package., The last few years, this has been a familiar story. The pandemic created supply chain crises and shortages all across the global economy., Mostly those have been resolved, so what's going on with tomatoes?, The main issue, says Harford, is a bad harvest out of Spain and Morocco, where Europe and the U.K. get a lot of their winter produce. A late frost and flooding killed a lot of the crops., (In the U.S., most of our winter vegetables come from Chile, Mexico and California, so our salads are safe for now.), The second issue: energy prices., The war in Ukraine has caused energy prices in Europe to spike. So growing tomatoes in greenhouses, as they do in the U.K. and the Netherlands, has gotten so expensive, a lot of farmers haven't done it this year, which has further cut back on supply., But a lot of people are also pointing to Brexit as a culprit., Now that the U.K. isn't part of the all important market — the European Union — it doesn't have as much muscle with suppliers when times are tight. It's in the back of the tomato line., Also the extra expense of bringing tomatoes from mainland Europe to the U.K., and navigating another layer of supply chains and transport might be raising prices beyond what many grocers (and customers) are willing to pay., Economist Tim Harford thinks Brexit isn't he main reason for tight tomato supplies — after all other parts of Europe are also experiencing shortages — but he says Brexit most certainly isn't helping., ""Brexit doesn't make anything easier,"" says Harford. ""It's going to make almost every problem slightly worse."", Harford also points out global supply chains are still normalizing from the pandemic, but overall have shown themselves to be impressively resilient., He thinks tomatoes will be back in abundance soon., Until then, U.K. minister Therese Coffey suggested Brits take a page from the past and eat turnips instead, which grow more easily in the clammy British climate., This suggestion sparked a raft of parodies on social media: The Bacon Lettuce and Turnip sandwich or a Brexit Margherita pizza (cheese and turnips)., British authorities have said tomatoes should turn up in supermarkets again in a month or so.",Economy

Housing development after housing development is slated for construction., A two lane highway is being widened in the former farming town of Buckeye, at the edge of the Phoenix sprawl, to make way for an 800 home ""master planned community."" A sign advertises new homes coming soon with the offer of joining ""the VIP interest list."", City officials proudly promote Buckeye as one of America's fastest growing cities. In 2000, the population was around 6,500. Today it's north of 111,000, according to the city's mayor Eric Orsborn. His city's master plan calls for future growth encompassing a staggering 640 square miles of open land to the south, west and north., ""For perspective, the city of Phoenix is about 518 square miles, so we have this massive footprint to grow into,"" Orsborn says., Buckeye, Ariz. Mayor Eric Orsborn says his desert city's master plan allows for the growth of upwards of 300,000 residents in the coming decades. Kirk Siegler/NPR hide caption, Buckeye, Ariz. Mayor Eric Orsborn says his desert city's master plan allows for the growth of upwards of 300,000 residents in the coming decades., But where are they going to get the water? The answer is complicated., Phoenix is now America's fifth largest city. And the growth and economic boom particularly in its West Valley is continuing unabated despite larger questions about the future of water supplies amid a 23 year megadrought on the Colorado River., Winter temperatures at the river's headwaters in the Rocky Mountains have risen by an estimated 3 degrees Fahrenheit since 1980, meaning less water for the region's snow fed reservoirs., Arizona has some of the lowest priority rights to the river water of any of the seven basin states. So Phoenix and its suburbs are increasingly turning to groundwater as the state has endured big cuts to Colorado River water., Buckeye, Arizona promotes itself as one of the fastest growing cities in America. Kirk Siegler/NPR hide caption, Buckeye, Arizona promotes itself as one of the fastest growing cities in America., In Buckeye, Mayor Eric Orsborn, who owns a construction company and also grew up in the West Valley, is accustomed to fielding questions from a skeptical public who he says doesn't always understand how meticulously water is managed in Arizona. In Buckeye, he says, the city recently implemented a drought management plan. They're investing heavily in water reuse and recycling and and working aggressively to find water to import., ""A lot of people want to move here,"" Orsborn says. ""Part of it is the regulation, the tax, how we do business in Arizona. Part of it is the open opportunity that's here."", But there's been a small damper on all the opportunity talk in the West Valley lately. Arizona's new Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, released a state report she says was hidden by her Republican predecessor Doug Ducey. It shows that most all of the ground water in the West Valley is already spoken for and allocated, if not over-promised already., ""I just think there was a lack of real honesty with the people of Arizona about the situation we're in,"" Hobbs said in an interview with NPR., Asked whether she thinks it's time to curb future development given the water crisis, Hobbs replied: ""I don't think we're there yet. But I think if we don't really address these issues head on, look at the reality of the situation with water, look at how quickly we're growing, then we will get to that point."", Arizona's new Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, says the extreme drought on the Colorado River is one of the biggest challenges of our time. Kirk Siegler/NPR hide caption, Arizona's new Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, says the extreme drought on the Colorado River is one of the biggest challenges of our time., Still, is Phoenix and the rest of booming central Arizona facing some sort of reckoning over growth? It's not yet clear., In Buckeye anyway, city officials welcomed the release of that Department of Water Resources analysis. Mayor Eric Orsborn says it helps his city better plan. For now, most of the construction is continuing because developers already had met the state requirement to prove they have a one hundred year water supply lined up., ""I don't think we want to shut off all of the growth trying to figure out the solution for all the growth, "" Orbsorn says. ""We can do this in an incremental approach."", Much of Buckeye's growth plan relies on taking revenues from the boom to go out and buy what would most likely be imported water from other basins to support future growth here., ""It's definitely our intent to make sure we're doing exactly what we're required to do so that we don't ever run out of water,"" Orsborn says., Phoenix and most of its suburbs have become really good at using a lot less water even as their populations boomed, according to Sarah Porter, director of the Kyle Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. Agriculture still uses the bulk of all the available water in Arizona - around 70%., ""We have largely decoupled urban growth from an increase in water demand,"" Porter says., Many cities have been pumping a lot of their Colorado River water into the underground aquifers where they've stored it for years. West Valley suburbs have also spent millions on conservation and recycling. The city of Peoria's water advisor Brett Fleck says they've been trying to wean themselves off the river for years.""When I see these headlines I think, yeah, if we continue on the path we're on, there might be an ecological disaster, there might be a real problem,"" Fleck says. ""It's scary to think about, but we're trying to change the direction that we're headed in so those things don't happen., People are even talking about a rescue plan to build a desalination plant on the Sea of Cortez and pipe water across Mexico to here. And it's not like the Hobbs groundwater report stopped new construction. Most developers in cities like Buckeye already had approval to build or expand planned communities and resorts from state and local regulators., But as is the case across the arid West, a lot of Arizona's rules on development and water are based on estimates - some written in cooler times - when most people didn't believe the Colorado River might actually run dry., One person sounding the alarms is Kathy Ferris, an attorney and former director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources.""For a long time a lot of those master planned community developers just thought well, we'll get to be able to do this, we'll get to be able to use this groundwater,"" Ferris says. ""And you know what? They can't because there's not enough of it and it's already over-allocated."", A similar parallel is being drawn with the Colorado River itself. Ferris helped write what was at the time hailed as a landmark groundwater management act passed in Arizona in 1980. Then, many cities were relying solely on groundwater to support their growth. Now, Gov. Hobbs wants to expand and modernize it, especially to regulate uncontrolled pumping in rural areas, which Ferris finds encouraging., ""We cannot just grow anywhere and everywhere and as much as we want and still sustain every kind of economy and economic growth that we want, we have to make choices,"" she says., John Hornewer is now driving up to three hours one way just to find water to buy and fill his trucks to deliver to the community of Rio Verde Foothills, which largely ran out of water January first. Kirk Siegler/NPR hide caption, John Hornewer is now driving up to three hours one way just to find water to buy and fill his trucks to deliver to the community of Rio Verde Foothills, which largely ran out of water January first., A cautionary tale of uncontrolled development in a desert lies north of the wealthy Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale., John Hornewer owns a water hauling company in Rio Verde Foothills, an unincorporated sliver of Maricopa County. Some people had wells but most families lived off of hauled water from Scottsdale, until that city cut them off at the start of this year, citing its shrinking Colorado River deliveries., ""You know what, when Scottsdale cut us off, that's a reality check,"" Hornewer says, standing next to one of his six silver delivery tank trucks. ""In my personal opinion, we're living way outside our means, you know, to build when you don't have water just doesn't make sense."", And yet even on his country road, lots are still for sale and even some houses are being built. A few miles away, neighborhood activist Karen Nabity and her husband are living on about twenty gallons of hauled water a day. (a typical US family uses upwards of 300 gallons a day). They've been rationing what's left in their underground tank since January first, the date deliveries were cut off., Karen Nabity and her husband are living on about 20 gallons of water a day.

But Nabity knows it's not a permanent solution. She says her home state needs to get much more aggressive cracking down on turf and especially outdoor watering and landscaping., ""The water is overallocated in Arizona and years ago they didn't think the river would ever stop flowing but guess what, it just might and we need to be prepared for that.""",Climate

A new study warns that hurricanes are getting more dangerous because of climate change. Rebecca Blackwell/AP hide caption, Debris along a canal in Fort Myers Beach, Fla., one week after Hurricane Ian. A new study warns that hurricanes are getting more dangerous because of climate change., Flooding and wind damage from hurricanes is getting more common in the United States, and that trend will accelerate and threaten millions of people as the Earth gets hotter according to new research., The findings highlight a counterintuitive effect of climate change: coastal communities are experiencing dangerous storms more frequently, even though the total number of storms doesn't appear to be changing., ""I think it's important for the public to take [this] seriously,"" says Adam Sobel, a climate scientist at Columbia University who was not involved in the new study. ""The storms are getting stronger. So even for the same number of storms, the number that are a real problem goes up because they are strengthening."", This trend is already clear for people living in places that have been hit by multiple devastating storms in recent years, such as southern Louisiana., The new study uses computer models to assess Atlantic storms going back to 1949, and to peer into the future to see what storms will look like in 2100. The authors, climate scientists at Princeton University, found that the flood and wind risk posed by storms has steadily increased., The problem will only get worse in the coming decades. ""The frequency of intense storms will increase,"" explains Ning Lin, a climate scientist at Princeton University and the lead author of the new study., Lin and her colleagues also found another sobering trend. Today it is unlikely that two damaging storms will hit the same place in quick succession, although such disasters got slightly more likely over the second half of the twentieth century., When sequential storms do happen, it's deadly, like when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the Gulf Coast in 2005 or when Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria hit Puerto Rico, Florida and Texas in quick succession in 2017., But by 2100, such consecutive shocks will become relatively commonplace, according to the new analysis., That's bad news for multiple reasons. ""Communities need to recover from disasters and bounce back,"" says Lin. If people are being hit by flooding and wind damage over and over, there's less time to recover., It could also overwhelm the government's emergency response. That happened in 2017, when the Federal Emergency Management Agency struggled to respond to three major storms at the same time, and millions of people were left waiting for basic assistance with food and shelter., Studies like this one offer important information about how to protect people from the effects of climate change, says Sobel. It matters where people live, and what that housing looks like. Right now, hurricane-prone areas, such as Florida, are seeing some of the fastest population growth in the country. ""The financial industry, the insurance industry and homeowners all need to adapt to increasing hurricane risk,"" he points out.",Climate

Last year alone, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration looked at the whole country and found 18 weather and climate disasters where losses topped $1 billion each. Susan Joy Hassol is a director of the nonprofit Climate Communication, and she's spent the past three decades working to help people understand climate change. Susan, I actually just said the word - or the term climate change. You don't use that. You prefer climate disruption. Why do words matter here? Well, words really do matter because they affect the way we think and feel about things. So, for example, some people are calling this crazy, wild weather we're seeing a new normal. But I call it a new abnormal. We shouldn't - there's nothing normal about it. We shouldn't normalize it and come to accept it. It should alarm us enough to spur more urgent climate action. You know, I also call what some people call natural disasters - in many cases, these weather disasters are unnatural disasters. And, you know, when you call something the new normal, it implies that we've come to a new steady state. But this is only the beginning. It's going to keep getting worse until we eliminate heat-trapping pollution.MARTÍ Yeah, and change certainly feels a lot softer than disruption. Yeah. You know, any kind of climate change for any reason is referred to as climate change. This is now human-caused climate disruption.MARTÍ Now, as more people experience the costs of extreme weather, are you hopeful at all that there will be maybe more of an effort to address this climate emergency? Well, absolutely. This is really, now, up close and personal. You know, this is not projections of the future. We're seeing it right outside our windows. And most Americans are now experiencing these kinds of disasters - floods, wildfires and the like. Seventy percent of Americans have experienced those things in the last few years, and they're coming to recognize that because of those - that extreme weather and the exacerbation of that, that this really is a crisis. And I think they are more willing and want to address it. The good news is that they like clean energy, and that's the main solution.MARTÍ And it took, you know, billions and billions in losses - in actual losses to people's pocketbook - to actually get to the point where I think we're starting to care a little bit more about this, right? And it took that - right? - and not maybe just some science. Well, absolutely. You know, people who think that if we just explain the science a little better and more clearly - or like the typical American tourist in Paris, thinking that if they just speak English more loudly and slowly, that people will understand them. But, you know, it's not about that. It's about people experiencing this on their own. Well, you know, the good news is really that tackling climate change does not need to be about sacrifice and deprivation. It can be about opportunity and improvement in our lives, our health and our well-being. It can be a story of humans flourishing in a post-fossil fuel age.MARTÍ So, Susan, how do you think scientists and policymakers should be talking about the issue? Because for a lot of people, it feels overwhelming, like they can't do enough, even if they do something in their lives. So how do you think this needs to be communicated? Got about 30 seconds left. Yeah. Well, you know, these are things that we want to do anyway.

Parts of Southern California were turned into a winter wonderland over the weekend after a winter storm dumped several feet of snow. In addition to the snowfall in higher elevations, the storm also brought several inches of rain to the area. And there's more wet weather in store this week, but the state remains under a drought emergency.MARTÍ Hayley Smith covers drought and climate change for the LA Times.Hayley, I took one look outside this weekend and decided to stay in and watch my wife bake bread. So tell us about the conditions and its impact on all the residents here in LA. So this was a low-pressure system that started in the Gulf of Alaska and kind of slowly carved a path down through California. And I would say it was somewhat of a novel storm in Northern California, but it was a historic storm here in Southern California. And that's for a few reasons. One, we saw a lot of record-setting precipitation, including really high rain rates. The weather station at the Burbank Airport measured 4.6 inches of rain on Friday, which wasn't just a record for the day, but it was actually its fifth-wettest day ever.But even more than the rain, what made this storm so historic was the snow. We were seeing snow at elevations as low as 1,500 or even a thousand feet, which is exceptionally low. For reference, the Hollywood sign is at an elevation of about 1,500 feet, and there were flurries there. And some people even made snowballs. The downside of all that is that hundreds of thousands of people are still without power. We've seen downed trees, rockslides, debris flows, a number of dangerous water rescues. So the storm did do some damage.MARTÍ Drought, though. Here's the thing. California has been in a drought seemingly forever. So how much of an impact is all of this doing on that? That is definitely a question on everyone's mind. Our reservoirs are notably fuller, and we've had record snowpack. We're at 173% of normal snowpack statewide right now. However, California's water supply does not only come from surface water. Groundwater didn't really benefit much from these storms, and neither did the Colorado River, which is a huge part of Southern California's water supply. So at this point, most experts and officials are saying it would still be premature to declare the drought over. But we are in much better shape than we were two months ago.MARTÍ OK. Now, more rain and snow is in the forecast for this week. I saw a lot of people stuck in flooding on the streets of LA and in other parts of California, too. So what should Californians prepare for? It should be weaker than what we saw this past week, but we still would advise people prepare for potential power outages and the hazards that I mentioned earlier and, of course, you know, not drive in standing water; learn how to turn on your windshield wipers, and probably avoid mountain passes that are still stuck and snowed out.MARTÍ Hayley Smith covers drought and climate change for the LA Times.Hayley, thanks. Thanks so much. ",Climate

They range from ambitious technology solutions, like nuclear fusion, to low-tech ones, like planting millions of trees. We wanted to get a sense of how legitimate these ideas are, so we turned to Julia Simon, NPR's climate solutions reporter. Julia, so nice to have you on the program. Thanks, Eyder. All right. So in a nutshell, what's the best way to address climate change? Scientists will tell you the big climate solution is to burn less fossil fuels and transition to more renewable energy and storage - become more efficient. OK, so totally logical. But then you hear about these exotic climate solutions, like the recent news about nuclear fusion. Is that a climate solution? Oh, nuclear fusion. Here's what Harvard historian of science Naomi Oreskes has to say about that. Oh, my God. I mean, just let me blow up there for a second, to use the fusion metaphor. I mean, people have been claiming that nuclear fusion was just around the corner since 1943. Oreskes says whenever you hear about a new, promising climate technology, ask yourself, is this technology actually available now? Is it affordable or scalable now? Whenever you hear the word breakthrough, some red flags should start flying. Killjoys. But what about when you buy an airplane ticket these days? Some airlines offer to take even more of your money to offset the carbon emissions from your flight. Is that money well spent? Often, it isn't. So an offset can be something like giving money to plant trees that will, in theory, soak up the carbon dioxide equivalent to your flight. But experts will tell you there are often issues verifying those offsets. What if those trees burn in a wildfire? If offsets don't work, that's adding more emissions. So adding emissions, that's going backwards. It's not working. And you can see this with carbon capture, too. That's this new technology to vacuum carbon dioxide out of the air. Right now, if the process uses fossil fuels, it can add more emissions. A climate solution, by definition, should not add more emissions to our atmosphere. So when we hear about these ideas, is there a yardstick that we can apply to figure out if it's legitimate or even promising? Yeah. Here's a tip from Melissa Aronczyk. She's a media professor at Rutgers University. When I hear the word solutions, immediately I think, who is coming up with this solution, and what do they say the problem is? If a company, for example, claims they're all about climate solutions but continues to invest in fossil fuels, Aronczyk says pay attention. That business may be trying to signal, we got this, and delay more meaningful action to cut climate pollution. And what's the government's role in all of this? We often think of businesses working on solutions on their own, but government often plays a big role in funding and research support for new climate tech. And scientists say governments will have to play a big role in regulating emissions. So this all relates to this solution I keep hearing about. Here's June Sekera, visiting scholar at The New School in New York. You know, it goes back to voting, who you vote into office. That's the bottom line. We can see this in Brazil, Eyder. Brazilians just voted in a new president, President Lula da Silva. He's pledged to address deforestation, a huge chunk of Brazil's emissions. So a big climate solution at your fingertips is to vote.

By night, he is a sought-after captain who vehemently turns down requests to smuggle human beings across the ocean., The number of people attempting to make the perilous journey from West Africa to Spain has risen in recent years, and so has the demand for captains from Saint-Louis., Those seeking to leave are mostly young and male, driven by the lack of jobs and a promise of opportunity on the other side of the ocean., Captains in Saint-Louis have spent centuries mastering the ocean.

A recent spate of whale deaths along the east coast have fueled misinformation about offshore wind development., A dozen dead whales have washed up on New York and New Jersey beaches since December. It's part of a years-long trend in whale deaths up and down the east coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is trying to figure out what's going on., The deaths have led some protesters to call for an end to offshore wind development, saying — without evidence — the sound of the boats and underwater surveying might confuse the whales. Some of those protesters are with the environmental group Clean Ocean Action, but some represent at least one conservative group that opposes offshore wind development., The Marine Mammal Commission, a federal agency charged with protecting marine mammals, said the deaths are ""not new, nor are they unique to the U.S. Atlantic coast."", Sixteen humpback whales alone have stranded along the Atlantic coast this winter. However, the Commission notes ""there is no evidence to link these strandings to offshore wind energy development."" Many of the deaths are attributed to being hit by ships or getting caught in fishing nets., NPR host Mary Louise Kelly talks to Jaclyn Jeffrey-Wilensky, a data reporter with member station WNYC, about the whale deaths along the east coast and how they're contributing to misinformation about wind energy., This interview has been edited for length and clarity., Tell us more about what's going on., We've had a number of dead whales washing up on our beaches in the last few months. The most recent one we reported on was just last week in Queens, which had large wounds on its body. NOAA says that's likely from a vessel strike. That's been the case for at least one other whale that washed up recently., How long has this been happening?, NOAA has been tracking what they call unusual mortality events since 2016. That's the term for when they notice that marine mammals are dying in unexpected ways or significant numbers. Right now on the east coast, they're seeing these events for humpback whales, North Atlantic right whales and minke whales. A lot of these whales die getting struck by ships or tangled up in nets. But it's not 100%., Over the weekend, there was a rather large protest in New Jersey over the whale deaths. The protesters were calling for a stop to offshore wind development in the area. Is there a connection between whale deaths and offshore wind?, Experts say there isn't., ""At this point, there's no evidence to support speculation that noise generated from wind development surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales,"" Kim Damon-Randall, director of the NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources, told WNYC., But some groups — and local politicians — have tried to link the deaths to the wind energy prep work being done in New York and New Jersey waters., They claim the sound of the boats might confuse the whales, even though the wind surveying is actually less noisy than fossil fuel exploration., What do we know about the protest groups? Are they environmentalists?, My colleague Nancy Solomon found that some of the people making this claim do belong to an environmental group, but others are just anti-wind power. She discovered that one organization, Protect Our Coast NJ, is connected to a conservative think tank with a long history of opposing clean energy., If it's likely not offshore wind development, what's driving this spike in whale deaths?, There's no one answer, but experts have some theories. One is that whales may be following prey into waters with more boat traffic, Damon-Randall says., Damon-Randall says another reason might be climate change. In response to warming oceans, ""we are seeing populations move around and go into areas that they haven't historically been in,"" she says., There may be more of some whales than there were before. Local humpbacks in particular are no longer considered endangered because of their population growth. More whales can mean more vessel strikes., What's being done about the vessel strikes and net entanglements that are happening to whales?, NOAA will keep tracking the whale deaths. Large boats are also being instructed to go slow around major ports in the area during winter and spring to reduce the odds of vessel strikes. NOAA is trying to extend those rules to include smaller boats, too., As for the anti-wind advocates, two Republican congressmen from New Jersey have proposed pausing the offshore wind development and are looking into how it got approved in the first place. But New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy says the work will continue.",Climate

It can be dangerous, even deadly for people who don't have permanent housing or live in tents and vehicles in places like Portland, Ore., which has seen nearly a foot of snow. Oregon Public Broadcasting's Conrad Wilson reports. You spent the night out here. Yeah. Why was that? That's where I live. That's where you live. What's your name?Rebecca Martell has been without a house for the past decade. And for the last several years, she's lived in almost the same spot along a busy road in southeast Portland, where she's pitched a tent and parked her white van. It was the cost of living that I couldn't find a place at first. And my daughter is out here, and she'll keep in contact with me as long as I'm out here better than she does if I'm in a home. So I stay out here. I'm trying to get her off the streets. For the past two days, temperatures have barely nudged above freezing. Portland is covered in snow, and the streets and sidewalks have been caked in ice. The city is neither accustomed to nor well-prepared for this kind of winter weather that took the region by surprise. And like many cities along the West Coast, Portland has a dramatic housing shortage and a growing population without stable housing. That includes more than 5,000 people living outside. In these times, we really all need to be paying attention to each other and looking out for each other. Rachel Pearl is deputy director of the Multnomah County Department of Human Services. The county includes the city of Portland. Pearl's team is helping coordinate emergency warming shelters, including more than 700 beds, which she says were a challenge for staff and volunteers to get up and running amid the nearly 11 inches of snow. We definitely didn't anticipate the accumulation of snow. The Multnomah County Medical Examiner's Office is investigating one person's death that may have been caused by hypothermia. Back on the street, 51-year-old Rebecca Martell says she's thought about going to one of the city's emergency shelters. Last night is when I started thinking about it, you know? But we got really warm this morning, so we're doing OK. She was just released from the hospital after she said she was physically attacked. She was in her van with her boyfriend when the temperatures started to drop this week and the snow began to fall.Do you guys need anything? Actually, we're OK. We got everything - water... All right. ...Clothing. We have everything. Martell says people dropped off blankets, socks, sweaters and other supplies. As I was leaving, a neighbor who had just made soup walked up to see if Martell was hungry. That's exactly the type of assistance local officials are hoping housed neighbors can provide. Temperatures are expected to warm up slightly tomorrow, but forecasts call for more cold weather and even snow, meaning more challenges for people living on Portland's streets.

But one proposal for a big wind project on federal land in Idaho is facing significant local opposition. Boise State Public Radio's Rachel Cohen reports. The site of the proposed wind farm outside of Twin Falls is high desert, lots of sagebrush and cheatgrass with outcroppings of lava rock from extinct volcanoes. But local rancher John Arkoosh says there's plenty of good grazing for cattle. This is bulbous bluegrass. And there's all kinds of native species out here, too. Arkoosh is one of several ranchers who lease this land from the Federal Bureau of Land Management, the BLM, to raise cattle. A New York company, LS Power, wants to build one of the biggest wind farms in the country here, up to 400 wind turbines across 76,000 acres. The company says it can mitigate impacts to ranchers, but Arkoosh is skeptical. There's seven different ranches that ran on this allotment alone. My own, there's four generations, four families who depend on this area for our livelihood. This project, called Lava Ridge, is exactly the type the Biden administration says is needed to transition the country's energy supply away from fossil fuels in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. The 1 gigawatt of power generated here could supply more than 300,000 homes. Already, permitted renewable energy projects on BLM-managed lands include more than 130 wind, solar and geothermal projects. Department of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland touted progress to Western governors late last year. A sustainable, clean energy economy isn't just an idea. It's here. It's happening. But there's opposition to Lava Ridge. Recently, about 300 people gathered in an airplane hangar to let the BLM know their feelings. #1: I mean, my God. Did you grow up here? #2: I did. #1: Do you care about what happens to us? #2: I do. #1: My God, I don't believe you. #2: That's why I'm here. And it's not just local ranchers who are fighting the wind farm. Just based on basic human rights, I have to oppose this. Karen Misako Hirai Olen was born near the site in what, at the time was an incarceration camp where the U.S. government sent Japanese Americans during World War II. It's now a national historic site. Thirteen thousand people were imprisoned there. Hirai Olen says the turbines nearby would fundamentally change the experience of going there and imagining the hardships of the incarcerated. They wouldn't build this outside of Arlington National Cemetery. They wouldn't build this on the Washington Mall. And to me, this site is just too sacred. LS Power says it's open to moving the turbines further from the historic site and says construction will pump $500 million into the local economy and generate $4 million a year in local taxes. Still, county commissioners oppose the wind farm. And the governor and other elected officials told the BLM it needs some big changes to win their support. Jungwoo Chun, a lecturer at MIT, studies opposition to renewable energy projects and says a temptation is to overlook local concerns for the greater good of solving the climate crisis. I'm sure many of those people who are actually the policy-makers probably weren't even aware that such local opposition could actually be detrimental to their plans. His research shows local pushback frequently delays or cancels projects or gets them tied up in lawsuits, so proponents need to take it seriously. A decision on this one is expected in the fall.

Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, Toyota unveils a new Prius in Tokyo on Nov. 16, 2022. A quarter century after Toyota introduced the Toyota Prius, hybrids remain popular with shoppers., A quarter century ago, Toyota unveiled a revolutionary vehicle: the Prius., The Prius was the first of a new category of cars, marrying an electric motor to a gasoline engine to dramatically increase fuel economy and reduce emissions., Today, hybrid vehicles remain popular with many drivers — enduringly popular, across a growing number of vehicle segments. That's even as a new revolution is unfolding, with automakers investing many billions of dollars in all-electric vehicles, which don't use gas at all., Car buyers still like hybrids because they can save on gas and cut their carbon footprint without having to deal with range anxiety or the need to charge at home., But even as hybrids go mainstream, they are losing traction among their original enthusiasts: environmentalists., Many say it's time for hybrids to fade into history; that they are at best a detour, and at worst an obstruction, in the fight against climate change., ""Right now we are facing a climate crisis, and we absolutely need to reduce our dependency on fossil fuel cars,"" says Katherine Garcia, who directs the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All campaign., Here's what to know about the environmental debate over hybrids., Hybrids may not get as much buzz as EVs, but they're flying off dealership lots., Take Steve Bond, who was eyeing some of the hybrids on display at the Washington, D.C., auto show last month. ""I think it's time to go from straight gasoline for a hybrid model for the better mileage,"" he said, explaining why he thought a hybrid Toyota Highlander would be his next vehicle., He's thought about an electric vehicle, but he says the lack of fast chargers for long-distance travel are keeping him from buying one today., He summed up his view on EVs in four words: ""Yes — but not yet."", Over in the Subaru exhibit, Carla Grenell also said she'd be much more likely to buy a hybrid than an EV., ""If I were able to plug in at my home, I would do that,"" she said. But as a city dweller she wasn't sure if she could charge at home — many people can't., Michelle Krebs, executive analyst with Cox Automotive, says these concerns are common. And as a result, hybrids are much more popular with shoppers than all-electric vehicles., ""About 11% of all new car shoppers look at EVs,"" she says. ""About 20% of all new car shoppers shop for hybrids."", Actual sales figures are lower, for both types of vehicles, because there aren't enough vehicles to meet demand. But the shopping figures show that a lot of people want hybrids, if they can get their hands on them., Initially, the Prius dominated the hybrid market. But today hybrids have expanded, with options in virtually every segment, as Toyota and other automakers continue to invest in them., There are still smaller vehicles, like the Prius, which just got a well-received redesign. (Sample review quote: ""We can't believe we're writing this in a Prius review, but — the new Prius is ... fun to drive!"" ) And it still gets a cool 57 miles to the gallon., Toyota unveiled another version of the Prius at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January 2000. The Toyota Prius, first introduced in Japan in 1997, was the world's first mass-produced gasoline/electric hybrid vehicle.

The Toyota Prius, first introduced in Japan in 1997, was the world's first mass-produced gasoline/electric hybrid vehicle., But SUVs outsell small cars across the market, including among hybrids. Toyota's hybrid RAV-4 crossover (41 miles to the gallon) and hybrid Highlander SUV (36 mpg) far outsold the Prius last year., Kia, Hyundai and Honda all offer hybrid SUVs in a variety of sizes. And Toyota's minivan, the Sienna, only comes as a hybrid (36 mpg)., Then there are pickup trucks. Ford sells a hybrid version of its F-150, and the popular Maverick — a smaller pickup designed to appeal to urban dwellers with a hankering for a truck — comes as a hybrid in its standard configuration. The Maverick gets about 42 miles to the gallon., And on the sportier side of the spectrum, Corvette just introduced its first hybrid: the E-Ray. The gas mileage isn't impressive. But with an electric motor about the size of a Folgers coffee can tucked between the front wheels, it's the fastest Corvette ever, capable of going from zero to 60 in 2.5 seconds., Right now, there is a debate unfolding across the auto industry — between companies, advocates and government regulators — about whether hybrids are helping or hurting in the current fight against climate change., To state the obvious, a hybrid vehicle is better for the climate and for human health than a gas guzzler., But as they look into the future, climate advocates are no longer emphasizing the need to make gas-powered cars more efficient. They want to reduce the number of car trips taken, by investing in public transit and walkability., And they want all new cars on the road to be zero-emissions vehicles, which right now, means all-electric vehicles, powered by a greener electric grid. Such a transition poses daunting challenges — from building vehicles to sourcing battery minerals., Garcia, with the Sierra Club, says it's essential to pull off the transition to zero-emissions vehicles as fast as possible. Every year of delay locks in carbon emissions for years to come given the increasingly long lifespan of vehicles on the road., ""Every year that goes by we are going to be extending the pollution from transportation,"" she says. ""The truth is, we should have transitioned 20 years ago."", These advocates are concerned that all the money and engineering know-how invested into hybrids is money and know-how that's not going into pure electric vehicles, slowing down the transition., A climate activist protest during a ""Fridays For Future"" climate strike on Sept. 23 in Chicago. Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, A climate activist protest during a ""Fridays For Future"" climate strike on Sept. 23 in Chicago., On the other side of the debate, you have Toyota., While it revolutionized hybrids, the Japanese automaker has long been vocally skeptical of EVs. As a result, it remains well behind its rivals in the race to bring them to market., Today, Toyota has a new CEO who has indicated more interest in all-electric vehicles. But the company continues to argue, to anyone who will listen, that hybrids can and should be a central component of fighting climate change., ""I guess we're taking a pragmatic approach to this,"" says Cooper Ericksen, a senior vice president at Toyota Motor North America responsible for battery electric vehicles., He points out that hybrids are significantly cheaper than EVs to produce and to buy, and they don't require a charger. A car shopper can buy a hybrid instead of a traditional gas vehicle without having to change their driving behavior at all, making it an easier sell., But even if all drivers were totally ready to leap to EVs, Toyota argues hybrids would still make sense. Because their batteries are so much smaller, a company can build far, far more hybrids than EVs from the same battery resources., The debate over hybrids is not hypothetical. Regulators have to decide if their policies need to focus on switching to EVs as fast as possible, or on encouraging hybrids and their better gas mileage., And in Europe, California and a number of other states, policymakers have adopted the more radical position, essentially mandating that all new cars be zero-emission by 2035. That may leave room for plug-in hybrids, but would not allow conventional hybrids, which require gasoline to run., To understand how regulators' views have shifted, consider what's parked in the driveway of Margo Oge, the former director of the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality., When the Prius first came out, she was thrilled. ""I was one of the first buyers,"" she says. ""I was excited because I want to walk the talk."", These days, however, she's driving an all-electric vehicle. And she's calling for her old agency to set ""ambitious"" national vehicle standards to accelerate the shift away from all vehicles with a gas tank — including the Priuses she used to love., Hybrids may once have been revolutionary, but Oge says her problem with them is simple: They still run on fossil fuels.",Business
https://www.npr.org/2023/02/21/1158580464/climate-change-has-forced-thousands-to-relocate-in-the-u-s,2023-02-21,Climate change has forced thousands to relocate in the U.S.,"Lee Hale, Christopher Intagliata, Ari Shapiro","We tell stories all the time about climate-fueled disasters that uproot people's lives - fires in California, hurricanes in Louisiana. Well, Jake Bittle's new book is about what happens in the years after those events. It's called ""The Great Displacement: Climate Change And The Next American Migration."" It goes from drought-hit farms in Arizona to flooded coastlines in Virginia. Jake Bittle, welcome to . Thank you for having me. So displacement is an interesting word choice in the title. And you open the book by explaining why you picked that word even though climate migration is becoming a more common term. Why do you consider this a displacement? Right. So migration - the word to me tends to imply an intentional movement from point A to point B. You know, somebody no longer wants to live where they do. So they get up, and they choose to move somewhere else that's better. And what I found was that in the United States and in other places, what's happening as climate disasters get worse is something much more chaotic. People tend to want to stay where they are for as long as they possibly can. In many cases, they find it devastating to leave behind the place that they are from.But more than that, they also don't really move very far. They don't really know where they're going, and they often don't necessarily stay to the place they move for a long period of time. So I think that because climate change exerts so much economic pressure and because the movements that follow these disasters are so chaotic, you can't really use the word migration as we tend to think of it. And so I was trying to find a word that sort of captured that chaos or that sort of frothy nature of the movement after these disasters. And I felt that displacement was a more accurate term. I think a lot of people imagine this to be something that happens elsewhere. You know, climate change is displacing people in Bangladesh or in the islands of the South Pacific. Did you have a hard time finding examples of people experiencing climate displacement in the U.S.? No, I didn't have a hard time at all. And, indeed, the reason why I wanted to do the book was because I felt that there were a lot of people out there who had moved in the aftermath of disasters but whose stories we just didn't tend to tell. All it took was to sort of go to the places where there had been disasters a few years earlier and start talking to people. And it was very easy to find dozens and hundreds of people who had ended up slowly migrating away or just not being able to make it back after a storm or a big fire. As I said, the book sort of hopscotches all over the country. What was your starting point? Where did you begin? I started in Houston. I had to work on a story about a federal government flood buyout program in the city of Houston, where basically the government would buy out homes that had seen repeated flooding, knock them down and give people money to move somewhere else. And there was this sort of range of outcomes here that I thought was really fascinating. Some people thought this program was exceptionally effective, that it helped people get out of places that were, you know, prone to flooding again and again. Some people thought it was really not great. You know, the government would give people a stipend to move, and they would basically not check on what happened to them. And a lot of them ended up moving into places that were just as vulnerable as the neighborhoods that they left behind.So this is a nationwide program. I wrote about it in Houston, but it sort of opened up this world to me of all these people who had - you know, tens of thousands of people every year who had moved after disasters. And we really just didn't know what happened to them. Even though the patterns of displacement are chaotic and unpredictable, there are certain consistent themes. Like, you say climate displacement exacerbates income inequality. And one place that's really apparent is Northern California. You write about the Tubbs Fire, which roared through Santa Rosa. What happened after that? So California was already experiencing a housing crisis, as everyone knows. But the city lost, you know, upwards of 4,000 housing units to the fire. And that took this already pretty severe housing crisis and just supercharged it to the point where wealthy people who had lost their homes were able to bid higher and higher and higher for rental apartments that were available. And in many cases, they actually took away rental apartments from people whose leases were expiring. So some people ended up doubling up with their parents. Some people moved as far away as Kentucky and only came back years later. But it was just kind of chaos. And the farther down you were on the income ladder, the less able you were to find housing in this sort of really severe post-disaster crunch. And a question that comes up a lot is, who's left holding the bag? Like, is it up to the federal government? Is it up to the homeowners? You describe in Norfolk, Va., where rising seas are flooding neighborhoods, that it's like people are passing around a stick of dynamite, hoping not to be the person holding it when it explodes. So when the reality of these situations, whether it's flooding or drought or what have you - when that finally becomes undeniable, like, who do we put the onus on? How is our country answering that question? Right. So right now we sort of have a partial and incomplete answer to that question, which is that the amount of money that gets doled out each year is nowhere near equivalent to the amount of damage, right? So the difference is usually made up by the homeowners and by the renters. The government and insurance companies don't distribute enough money to make up that difference. So homeowners end up bearing the cost of these excessively damaging disasters, whether that's through having to leave and exert themselves to find more affordable housing or having to dig into their savings to protect, you know, the life of their mortgage and make sure their house is actually worth something. These are inevitably challenging, difficult situations with answers that are not easy. But were there scenarios that you thought, that was handled really well; people wound up in a good place after that policy was implemented? Yes, there are a few of those. There's not a ton. So during the Obama administration, the federal government handed down a bunch of money, about a billion dollars, to sort of do a pilot program for different - what they called resilience strategies, different ways of adapting to climate change. And in an African American neighborhood of Norfolk called Chesterfield Heights, which has seen, you know, really, really frequent flooding from high tide events and from storms, the city was able to spend upwards of a hundred million dollars to create this park that would absorb tides to create these really beautiful berms along the water that would sort of stop storm surge from happening and also to fix this really outdated stormwater system that really wasn't handling rain events very well.And it went from a neighborhood where property values were going to decline and nobody really wanted to move there because it was just - it was so vulnerable to flooding. And it went to a neighborhood that now has some of the best infrastructure in the city and certainly is going to be resilient in the coming decades to the rising sea levels that are happening off the coast of Virginia. We're at the beginning of a trend that will only accelerate. So what does the future look like? I mean, how many Americans are likely to be forced to relocate because of climate change? Where are they likely to go? Can you paint a picture of what the U.S. might look like decades from now? Yeah. It's really, really difficult to know with any certainty what the U.S. will look like decades from now. But I think what we can say with certainty is that people will continue to lose their homes - you know, hundreds of thousands probably on average each year. That's already, you know, a pretty good ballpark estimate of the number of people whose homes get damaged or destroyed by climate disaster each year. So you could imagine a situation where, from the coasts or from the hottest parts of the country, the parts that are most prone to wildfire, people start to move towards cities that tend to be a little more temperate while not being so far away that they're unfamiliar, right? So some demographers predict that people might move from Miami, say, to Orlando or Atlanta, or they might move from Houston to Dallas, but it will be very messy. You know, it won't be a coherent march northward. It will be a lot of churning and back-and-forth. And then eventually these trends might emerge over the decades.

United Nations members gather Monday in New York to resume efforts to forge a treaty to safeguard the world's marine biodiversity., United Nations members gather Monday in New York to resume efforts to forge a long-awaited and elusive treaty to safeguard the world's marine biodiversity., Nearly two-thirds of the ocean lies outside national boundaries on the high seas where fragmented and unevenly enforced rules seek to minimize human impacts., The goal of the U.N. meetings, running through March 3, is to produce a unified agreement for the conservation and sustainable use of those vast marine ecosystems. The talks, formally called the Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction, resume negotiations suspended last fall without agreement on a final treaty., ""The ocean is the life support system of our planet,"" said Boris Worm, a marine biologist at Canada's Dalhousie University. ""For the longest time, we did not feel we had a large impact on the high seas. But that notion has changed with expansion of deep sea fishing, mining, plastic pollution, climate change,"" and other human disturbances, he said., The U.N. talks will focus on key questions, including: How should the boundaries of marine protected areas be drawn, and by whom? How should institutions assess the environmental impacts of commercial activities, such as shipping and mining? And who has the power to enforce rules?, ""This is our largest global commons,"" said Nichola Clark, an oceans expert who follows the negotiations for the nonpartisan Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C. ""We are optimistic that this upcoming round of negotiations will be the one to get a treaty over the finish line."", The aim of the talks is not to actually designate marine protected areas, but to establish a mechanism for doing so. ""The goal is to set up a new body that would accept submissions for specific marine protected areas,"" Clark said., Marine biologist Simon Ingram at the University of Plymouth in England says there's an urgent need for an accord. ""It's a really pressing time for this — especially when you have things like deep-sea mining that could be a real threat to biodiversity before we've even been able to survey and understand what lives on the ocean floor,"" Ingram said., Experts say that a global oceans treaty is needed to actually enforce the U.N. Biodiversity Conference's recent pledge to protect 30% of the planet's oceans, as well as its land, for conservation., ""We need a legally binding framework that can enable countries to work together to actually achieve these goals they've agreed to,"" said Jessica Battle, an expert on oceans governance at World Wide Fund for Nature, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Monica Medina said the treaty was a priority for the country. ""This agreement seeks to create, for the first time, a coordinated approach to establishing marine protected areas on the high seas,"" she said. ""It's time to finish the job."", Officials, environmentalists and representatives of global industries that depend on the sea are also watching negotiations closely., Gemma Nelson, a lawyer from Samoa who is currently an Ocean Voices fellow at the University of Edinburgh, said that small Pacific and Caribbean island countries were ""especially vulnerable to global ocean issues,"" such as pollution and climate change, which generally they did not cause nor have the resources to easily address., ""Getting the traditional knowledge of local people and communities recognized as valid"" is also essential to protect both ecosystems and the ways of life of Indigenous groups, she said., With nearly half the planet's surface covered by high seas, the talks are of great importance, said Gladys Martínez de Lemos, executive director of the nonprofit Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense focusing on environmental issues across Latin America., ""The treaty should be strong and ambitious, having the authority to establish high and fully protected areas in the high seas,"" she said.

Last week's storm came hard on the heels of another major storm that caused widespread flooding and landslides. And, as Rebecca Rosman reports, these weather events have New Zealand thinking about ways to mitigate climate change. This is our paradise. Frank Fan thought he had found the property of his dreams when he bought this secluded ranch house just north of central Auckland eight years ago. He says it took only 30 minutes to become unlivable late last month, after the city received a record-breaking 10 inches of rain in just a few hours. Just something like you putting a plug into your bathtub. He faced the same nightmare all over again this week after the Auckland region was hit with another eight inches of rain thanks to Cyclone Gabrielle. It left at least five people dead and nearly a quarter million without power. Sam Dean is with New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research. We know that climate change has the greatest effect on these really short-duration, convective, flash-flooding events. Flash-flooding events that he says are only becoming a more regular and more immediate issue, especially given that many of New Zealand's cities and towns have been built around flood plains. Sea level rise is a long-term problem for climate change that has massive consequences. But flooding is a very immediate problem. Jake Parsons is with the nonprofit group Student Volunteer Army. They've gone into more than 1,300 homes, including Frank Fan's, over the last few weeks to help distressed families clean up the damage. There are plenty more that need our help. They may be waiting for insurance or waiting for other forms of help and may reach out to us later. Frank Fan had insurance, but insurance companies may be far more reluctant to cover homes like his, built in flood-prone areas, in the future, says Paul Williams. Williams is professor emeritus at the environmental science department at The University of Auckland. Because they're paying the cost at the moment in repairing a lot of the damage. Another challenge is New Zealand's aging infrastructure, says Michelle McCormick. She's the policy director at Infrastructure New Zealand, an advocacy group that works with the country's public and private sector. Our infrastructure was designed for weather that we were experiencing 50, 60 years ago, not now, with climate change. The government knows it has a problem. Last year, it published the country's first national adaptation plan, a long-term strategy to help adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change in the country of 5 million. One strategy, McCormick says, is a newer urban planning model called sponge cities. To soak up the rainfall that's coming down. We've got more green space, got more grassy areas. Not everything is cemented and concrete. It's an idea already being implemented in major cities around the world, including New York and Shanghai. Other proposals being discussed are incentivizing people to move out of at-risk areas and widening rivers to absorb more water. All of this will take time and money to implement. But Professor Paul Williams says these latest storms have been a wake-up call for the country. We do learn in the end. But you're beaten with a big stick, and the big stick in this case is severe storms. Severe storms Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said the country was simply unprepared for, as he assessed the damage from Cyclone Gabrielle. We can't continue the way we have been going, he told reporters. We're going to see more of these types of weather events, so we have to be prepared. For NPR News, I'm Rebecca Rosman in Auckland.

But it has been getting harder to make a living raising cattle there. So Houser was excited when a solar company showed up offering to lease his property. It would have been good money heading into retirement. But his hopes were dashed by a four-year battle against solar development in Page County. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, Roger Houser's ranching business was getting squeezed. The calves he raises in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley were selling for about the same price they had a few years earlier, while costs for essentials like fuel and fertilizer kept going up. But Houser found another use for his 500 acres., An energy company offered to lease Houser's property in rural Page County to build a solar plant that could power about 25,000 homes. It was a good offer, Houser says. More money than he could make growing hay and selling cattle., ""The idea of being able to keep the land as one parcel and not have it split up was very attractive,"" Houser says. ""To have some passive income for retirement was good. And then the main thing was the electricity it would generate and the good it would do made it feel good all the way around."", But soon after he got the offer, organized opposition began a four-year battle against solar development in the county. A group of locals eventually joined forces with a nonprofit called Citizens for Responsible Solar to stop the project on Houser's land and pass restrictions effectively banning big solar plants from being built in the area., Houser says Page County residents who fought solar development were driven by a not-in-my-back-yard mentality. ""It's pretty. It's open ground,"" Houser says of his property. ""But it's like, you know, some panels on it, that's not going to change it."" Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, Citizens for Responsible Solar is part of a growing backlash against renewable energy in rural communities across the United States. The group, which was started in 2019 and appears to use strategies honed by other activists in campaigns against the wind industry, has helped local groups fighting solar projects in at least 10 states including Ohio, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, according to its website., ""I think for years, there has been this sense that this is not all coincidence. That local groups are popping up in different places, saying the same things, using the same online campaign materials,"" says Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University., Citizens for Responsible Solar seems to be a well-mobilized ""national effort to foment local opposition to renewable energy,"" Burger adds. ""What that reflects is the unfortunate politicization of climate change, the politicization of energy, and, unfortunately, the political nature of the energy transition, which is really just a necessary response to an environmental reality."", Citizens for Responsible Solar was founded in an exurb of Washington, D.C., by a longtime political operative named Susan Ralston who worked in the White House under President George W. Bush and still has deep ties to power players in conservative politics., Ralston tapped conservative insiders to help set up and run Citizens for Responsible Solar. She also consulted with a longtime activist against renewable energy who once defended former President Donald Trump's unfounded claim that noise from wind turbines can cause cancer. And when Ralston was launching the group, a consulting firm she owns got hundreds of thousands of dollars from the foundation of a leading GOP donor who is also a major investor in fossil fuel companies. It's unclear what the money to Ralston's firm was used for. Ralston has previously denied that Citizens for Responsible Solar received money from fossil fuel interests., Ralston said in an email to NPR and Floodlight that Citizens for Responsible Solar is a grassroots organization that helps other activists on a volunteer basis. The group isn't opposed to solar, Ralston said, just projects built on farmland and timberland. Solar panels belong on ""industrial-zoned land, marginal or contaminated land, along highways, and on commercial and residential rooftops,"" she said., But her group's rhetoric points to a broader agenda of undermining public support for solar. Analysts who follow the industry say Citizens for Responsible Solar stokes opposition to solar projects by spreading misinformation online about health and environmental risks. The group's website says solar requires too much land for ""unreliable energy,"" ignoring data showing power grids can run dependably on lots of renewables. And it claims large solar projects in rural areas wreck the land and contribute to climate change, despite evidence to the contrary., It's hard to quantify the effect that Citizens for Responsible Solar is having on local debates over solar development. ""But I've sure seen their impact,"" says Ronald Meyers, director of the Renewable Energy Facility Siting project at Virginia Tech. ""It's sowed seeds of alarm and distrust."" Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, It's hard to quantify the effect that Citizens for Responsible Solar is having on local debates over solar development. ""But I've sure seen their impact,"" says Ronald Meyers, director of the Renewable Energy Facility Siting project at Virginia Tech. ""It's sowed seeds of alarm and distrust."", People often have valid concerns about solar development. Like any infrastructure project, solar plants that are poorly planned and constructed can potentially harm communities. But misinformation spread by groups like Citizens for Responsible Solar is turning rural landowners unfairly against renewables, says Skyler Zunk, an Interior Department official under President Donald Trump and chief executive of Energy Right, a conservative-leaning nonprofit that supports solar projects that preserve ecosystems., Analysts and industry participants say the prevalence of bad information is also increasing pressure on local officials who are often charged with approving renewable energy projects. Many are wary of proposed development because of the political blowback it can bring. ""This type of misinformation is very difficult to dispel. And politicians are just afraid of getting engaged with it,"" says Ronald Meyers, director of the Renewable Energy Facility Siting project at Virginia Tech., Getting projects built in the face of local opposition is among the biggest challenges wind and solar companies face. A 2022 report by the Sabin Center at Columbia University found 121 local policies around the country that are aimed at blocking or restricting renewable energy development, a nearly 18% increase from the year before., Solar restrictions are gaining traction as the stakes for addressing climate change keep rising. Construction of more renewable energy is key to the country's plans to cut greenhouse gas pollution and avoid the worst damage from extreme weather in the years ahead., ""It's an enormous concern,"" says Alan Anderson, a lawyer in Kansas who represents renewable energy companies. ""If we can't get projects permitted at counties or townships or whatever local level makes a decision, we can't do any of the goals we think we need to do for climate change."", , Susan Ralston launched Citizens for Responsible Solar to stop a project near her home in Culpeper, Va., about 70 miles southwest of Washington, D.C. She brought years of experience in the upper echelons of national conservative politics to her new role as a county-level organizer against rural solar., Ralston served as special assistant to former President George W. Bush and as a top aide to Karl Rove in the White House. She resigned in 2006 when a congressional investigation found that she passed messages to Rove from her former boss, the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. The investigation did not accuse her of any wrongdoing., After leaving the White House, Ralston started her own consulting firm, SBR Enterprises LLC. In 2012, she organized a fundraiser for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign that was hosted by GOP luminaries. She's currently listed as a senior adviser at a nonprofit that works to elect conservative women., As she was setting up Citizens for Responsible Solar, Ralston got help from operatives who have worked behind the scenes with some of the most powerful people in conservative politics., The treasurer of Citizens for Responsible Solar is Lisa Lisker. Lisker was treasurer for a campaign committee for J.D. Vance, who was elected last year as a Republican senator from Ohio. Her firm does financial consulting for Republican candidates and political committees to ensure that they comply with campaign finance laws., Solar restrictions are gaining traction as the stakes for addressing climate change keep getting higher. Construction of more renewable energy is a key part of the country's plans to cut heat-trapping pollution and avoid the worst damage from extreme weather in the decades ahead. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, When there's official paperwork that has to get to Citizens for Responsible Solar, it goes through a firm created by a lawyer named Jason Torchinsky. The same firm has been the registered agent for at least two dozen conservative organizations based in Virginia. One of them was a voter-focused group headed by Leonard Leo, who helped remake the federal judiciary through the Federalist Society. NPR and Floodlight haven't verified whether any of the conservative groups that use Torchinsky's firm as a registered agent have ties to Citizens for Responsible Solar., Torchinsky is also a partner at a law firm that Bloomberg News once described as ""a boutique outfit that specializes in advising organizations that want to participate in the electoral process without disclosing who's paying their bills."", Torchinsky has worked as a lawyer for Americans for Prosperity, an influential activist group that promotes conservative causes. And he's represented the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), an association of companies and Republican state legislators that has engineered and spread anti-climate messaging and draft legislation., And Ralston's consulting firm, SBR Enterprises, got almost $300,000 from The Paul E. Singer Foundation between 2018 and late 2020 — the period when she was setting up Citizens for Responsible Solar. Paul Singer, the foundation's president, is chairman of the Manhattan Institute, a think tank that has criticized government support of renewable energy. His investment firm, Elliott Management, is the largest shareholder in the coal producer Peabody Energy Corp., Getting projects built in the face of local opposition is one of the biggest challenges wind and solar companies face in the United States. A 2022 report by the Sabin Center at Columbia University found 121 local policies around the country that are aimed at blocking or restricting renewable energy development, a nearly 18% increase from the year before. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, Ralston and the Singer Foundation declined to tell NPR and Floodlight what the money to SBR Enterprises was for. The foundation's tax filings say the firm was a ""consultant for the foundation mission."", Ralston reportedly said to E&E News in 2019 that no money from fossil fuel interests went to Citizens for Responsible Solar. Since then, she has declined NPR and Floodlight's requests to identify the organization's sources of funding., Lisa Graves, executive director of the progressive watchdog group True North Research, says Ralston has surrounded her group with ""a national network of right-wing political activists who are very powerful, very, very plugged in."", Graves adds: ""Having them invested in one way or the other in her agenda here is a sign that this is a key tactical component of the way that powerful right-wing donors or strategists want to attack solar."", Ralston didn't respond to subsequent emails seeking comment. Torchinsky and Lisker did not respond to repeated messages seeking comment., Around the time Ralston founded Citizens for Responsible Solar in Culpeper, Va., she got involved in debates over solar projects in other communities. One of the first places she went was the bedroom community of Spotsylvania, Va., tucked between Richmond and Washington, D.C. A solar company had purchased 6,350 acres of land there, and it was asking for approval to build the largest project east of the Rockies., Greg Benton, a county supervisor at the time, was tasked with determining whether it would be a good thing for Spotsylvania. ""I'm not a big energy person, one way or the other. I think solar will make a difference in helping the electric companies and helping the planet a little bit,"" Benton says. ""I wanted to do right by the county with this project."", A Republican who had worked at the local sheriff's and fire departments, Benton spent months researching the project. He looked into concerns over stormwater management and fears that toxic materials like cadmium could be in the solar panels and leak out, hurting people or the environment. Benton found no major risks., But he was soon overwhelmed by local activists who criticized the project's impact on the landscape and pushed issues that Benton says he'd debunked or addressed., ""I think initially they were concerned about it, and they had some legitimate concerns,"" he says. ""I think it was from bad information. Just information that was not true, not factually based."", Ralston declined to discuss her relationship with activists in Spotsylvania. But she told E&E News in 2019 that she ""worked closely"" with residents there who opposed the project. ""Their fight is much, much bigger,"" Ralston told E&E. ""They don't have as much financial resources that I have."", After months of angry public hearings, Spotsylvania County ultimately approved the project in 2019. The loss in Spotsylvania was an early setback for Ralston. But her campaign was just getting started. Shortly after she formed Citizens for Responsible Solar, the solar company she was organizing against in Culpeper cited ""community concerns"" and withdrew its project application. Soon, Citizens for Responsible Solar grew in size and influence and spread beyond Virginia., Houser says a lot of farming families are under financial pressure, which is leading many to consider their alternatives. ""All this farmland is going to make some kind of transition when my generation retires,"" he says. ""And, you know, a lot of it's going to just turn up into house lots. And that's unfortunate, because it never reverts back to farmland. It's gone."" Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, Many grassroots activists today credit their success in stopping solar projects to Ralston. One of them is Kathy Webb. Webb says she learned that a company wanted to clear a forest for a solar plant near her home in Rowan County, N.C., days before local officials planned to vote. She sent out a flurry of emails to anyone she thought could help. Somehow, a message came back from Ralston., Ask the county to delay the vote, Ralston told her. And get a lawyer. It worked, Webb says. The solar company scrapped its plan. ""Susan guided us in the right direction and then helped us with information,"" she says. Ralston's advice ""absolutely was part of us defeating it."", Soon, Webb was spreading Ralston's message throughout North Carolina. She runs the Facebook page Rowan County Citizens for Responsible Solar, where she posts material that's emailed out from Ralston's organization., The reach of Citizens for Responsible Solar appears to extend across the U.S. On Facebook, at least two dozen groups and pages dedicated to defeating solar projects feature the same term: responsible solar. There's a Kansans for Responsible Solar and an Iowa for Responsible Solar. Ralston spoke at a fundraiser last year for a Kentucky-based group called Hardin County Citizens for Responsible Solar., In her only substantive email to NPR and Floodlight, Ralston said she offers help to those who ask. While other groups might adopt the name ""Citizens for Responsible Solar,"" she says they aren't ""affiliated"" with her organization., Ralston's group has nurtured networks of activists who often work together across state lines. In testimonials, people from South Carolina to Maine say Citizens for Responsible Solar connected them with other activists and gave them resources to sway local officials., In one Virginia county, for example, Citizens for Responsible Solar gave residents information about ""the science and downsides"" of solar. It then put one of those activists in touch with someone in New Jersey who was looking for information about the solar industry. And it connected people in Pennsylvania with John Droz, an activist who has spent years challenging mainstream climate science and trying to limit renewable energy development., ""Susan was a great resource for information and, probably more importantly, inspiration,"" says Jim Thompson, who runs an Ohio group called Against Birch Solar. ""There's times, you know, you get down in the valleys, and you don't know that you're making a darned difference. And you reach out to people like Susan and share your frustration, maybe get some insight as to what you might be doing wrong."", Citizens for Responsible Solar says it isn't opposed to solar; just projects that are built on farmland and timberland. Solar panels belong on ""industrial-zoned land, marginal or contaminated land, along highways, and on commercial and residential rooftops,"" Susan Ralston, the group's leader, said in an email. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, Ralston didn't have contacts of her own in Ohio, Thompson says, so she made him part of her network. When people in Ohio reached out to Ralston, ""then she would start sending them to me,"" Thompson says., Ralston's growing influence has drawn criticism from renewable energy advocates across the political spectrum. Ray Gaesser is chair of the Iowa Conservative Energy Forum, which promotes renewable energy to drive economic growth. In 2021, he warned that Citizens for Responsible Solar — ""a dark-money organization based in Virginia"" — was meddling in local affairs., Groups like Citizens for Responsible Solar ""are operating from the same playbook featuring shared materials and draft petitions from national sources that originate thousands of miles from Iowa,"" Gaesser wrote in an op-ed in The Gazette newspaper in Iowa., ""Their mission is to kill new development,"" Gaesser said in the op-ed, ""not to help develop common-sense ordinances."", Ralston's group has grown as the world grapples with how to swiftly cut greenhouse gas pollution that drives climate change. Big solar and wind projects on vast tracts of land are the cheapest and fastest way right now to add lots of energy without increasing greenhouse gases., But Zunk, the former Trump administration official, says limiting global warming isn't driving development. Companies build solar projects because they make financial sense, he says. ""They're not coming because of the Green New Deal,"" says Zunk. ""They're not coming because of any government action."", The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects the amount of solar capacity added in America this year from big power plants will be more than double the current annual record., All that growth means local land-use fights will keep flaring up., The strategy Ralston uses has been the basis of many social movements. ""There's often this hub and spoke model, and there are resources that are planted in different places,"" says Burger of the Sabin Center at Columbia University. What's noteworthy here, he says, is that ""what people are advocating for is based on misinformation and is antithetical to, not only the public good, but to probably their own self-interest, in most instances."", A power line running through Roger Houser's property was one of things that made his land attractive for a solar plant. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, Misinformation spreads easily online. It bounces around in echo chambers where dubious articles, videos and memes are posted and shared repeatedly. Longtime critics of the wind industry like John Droz cultivated opposition strategies that are now being used in the fight against solar, says Anderson, the renewable energy lawyer in Kansas., ""The geometric growth of misinformation by the same people posting to 50 different places, that method and that impact flows through to solar, just as it did to wind. The gathering of groups and creating a social unit so that people become emotionally and socially tied to the group is the same for solar as it was for wind,"" Anderson says. ""Then it is just new talking points for the different technology."", When Ralston was setting up Citizens for Responsible Solar, Droz was one of the people she consulted., Droz is a member of the CO2 Coalition, a nonprofit supported by fossil fuel magnate Charles Koch that promotes ""the important contribution made by carbon dioxide to our lives and the economy."" As a science adviser for a group of coastal North Carolina counties that promotes economic development, Droz helped stall state efforts to consider climate change in coastal planning., A decade ago, Droz shared a memo for a national public relations campaign against wind power at a meeting of activists in Washington, D.C. The memo was aimed at undermining public support for the wind industry ""in what should appear as a 'groundswell' among grassroots."", The amount of solar capacity that's expected to be added in the U.S. this year from big power plants is more than double the current record, says the U.S. Energy Information Administration. All that growth means local land-use fights will keep flaring up. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, Droz's website provides model ordinances that activists like Ralston can use in their own communities. It also features a list of ""solar energy concerns,"" including claims of environmental harm and the potential loss of farmland. Droz calls himself an ""educator"" and says his website is meant only to share information, adding that he doesn't get involved in debates outside of his own community., ""All I've tried to do is to provide the other side of the coin, sort of things here that aren't being told by state agencies or the federal government,"" he says., A number of the concerns Droz raises are echoed on the website for Citizens for Responsible Solar. The information on Ralston's website is ""extremely misleading and appears designed to be misinformation,"" says Meyers of Virginia Tech., That includes claims that solar projects ruin the land they're built on. With the right practices, companies can improve local ecosystems, Meyers says, and farming can continue alongside power plants. He also says the group's warnings about hazardous waste from solar don't account for the fact that most solar panels aren't considered toxic and won't leach material., Ralston didn't respond to subsequent emails seeking comment., ""I'm just saying that there are credible people who have expressed these concerns,"" Droz says of the information he puts out., Susan Corbett was thrilled when a solar company showed up in Page County looking for places to build. ""I thought, 'What a great opportunity for a lot of the struggling farmers around here to have that income coming in and be of some benefit to everybody,'"" says Corbett, who owns River's Bend Ranch. ""Well, that was not the way it was received."" Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, In Page County, Houser says he heard a lot of positive feedback at first when a solar company proposed building the project on his land. But then, he says, ""local politics got involved."", He says: ""Anybody can stand up in a public hearing and say anything, regardless of the facts or science or whatever."", At public hearings starting in 2018, some residents said the solar plant would create problems with stormwater runoff, ruin their views and harm property values, as well as the local tourism and agriculture industries. Others falsely claimed solar panels would poison the groundwater and cause cancer., A year later, Page County rejected the project and put a moratorium on new development., As she watched the growing backlash against solar in Page County, Corbett says she was surprised by how consistent the messaging was from the opposition: ""You could tell it was coming from one source,"" she says, ""because they all had the same song."" Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, Things got more tumultuous from there. Urban Grid, the company that offered to lease Houser's property, resubmitted plans for the project in late 2020. And a group calling itself Page County Citizens for Responsible Solar created a Facebook page to organize local opposition. Ralston's organization applied pressure, too, saying it had hired a ""prestigious law firm"" to investigate the county's actions., The battle finally ended in 2022. After Page County adopted a solar ordinance, Urban Grid abandoned Houser's project. The new law doesn't outright ban big solar plants, but it imposes so many restrictions that there's no place to build, says Peter Candelaria, chief executive of Urban Grid., Candelaria says it was a missed opportunity, and not just for companies and landowners who stood to make money. The project on Houser's property could have generated millions of dollars for Page through land and equipment taxes, as well as payments under a siting agreement, he says. And the soil underneath the project could have been improved with regenerative land practices, Candelaria says, like grazing sheep around the panels., Keith Weakley, a member of Page County's Board of Supervisors, says officials worried that big solar projects could hurt existing businesses without creating any long-term jobs., Along the road by Houser's property, signs were still up in December saying solar doesn't belong there. ""I find it funny that the signs say 'No solar on our farmland,'"" Houser says. ""I've asked a couple of [opponents] if they'd like to come help make hay in June, and none of them have volunteered to come help with their farmland."" Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, Page County Citizens for Responsible Solar didn't respond to messages seeking comment., With the chance to put up solar panels gone, Houser has been talking to a poultry company that wants his land. But the recent outbreak of bird flu put the plan on hold. ""We're as efficient as we can be in our operation here, and we're as sustainable as we can be, and we take good care of the land. But we're running out of time,"" Houser says of the financial pressure farmers are under. ""Everybody's faced with the same thing, every farm family."", Looking back, Houser doesn't know what he or Urban Grid could have done to get to a different outcome. ""We just presented the facts,"" he says. ""The anti-solar people took it on as a cause, and it became a movement of its own. In small-town politics, you can have a small group of people become very vocal and seem very influential."", This story is a collaboration with Floodlight, a nonprofit environmental news organization., Siri Chilukuri contributed reporting to this article.",Climate

The people of Jharkhand rely on the coal industry for jobs, pensions, electricity, fuel and more, with at least a few million of the state's 40 million residents believed to be informal or illegal coal workers. Jharia is essentially one large coalfield dotted with vulnerable villages.

Families have been facing relocation for years, and Anjali fears the mine and fires will one day displace her family and separate her from her friends. She says some of the homes in their village, Ghansadih, have already been damaged or destroyed by the land subsidence and fires from decades of large-scale mining activity. Bharat Coking Coal Limited did not respond to NPR's request for comment., Opencast coal mining, in which the rocks are extracted from pits and not tunneled mines, can destroy the land and cause significant air pollution. Coal accounts for about 70% of electricity generation in India, which is the third-biggest global emitter of greenhouse gases. One study estimates that in 2018, more than 30% of the country's annual deaths for people over the age of 14, as well as one in five deaths worldwide, were attributable to air pollution from fossil fuels., Anjali, 16, in the pits of Ghansadih mine, Jharia, where she collects coal in the morning.

Mose Buchele/KUT hide caption, The 2021 winter storm left millions of Texans without power in below-freezing temperatures for days., Two years ago this week, Texans woke up to something many had never seen before: snow. It was not the annual heavy frost or light dusting. It was honest-to-God snow. A thick blanket of it, inches deep, had covered everything while we slept.And, for millions, the power was out., These two facts competed for our attention. For my Texas family, and many others, power outages are more common than snow storms. In this case, it seemed, the state power grid had to conserve electricity because of the storm, and we had been cut off as part of those measures. I figured the lights would return by nightfall., This story comes to us from KUT in Austin, Texas. Your support of KUT and the NPR Network makes all kinds of local journalism possible.

Texas lawmakers approved a package of measures aimed at addressing what went wrong during one of the worst power outages in U.S. history. LM Otero/AP hide caption, In February, Ricki Mills watches from her Dallas home as she waits for a fire hydrant to be turned on to get water. Texas lawmakers approved a package of measures aimed at addressing what went wrong during one of the worst power outages in U.S. history., Texas state lawmakers had just started a legislative session when deadly blackouts gripped the state in February. The timing was fortunate. In Texas, legislators typically meet only once every two years. The fact that they were already in Austin meant they could act quickly, and many vowed to shore up the state's electric grid and create safeguards against future power outages., This week lawmakers approved a sweeping package of measures to address specific problems that threaten electric reliability — some of them despite opposition from the oil and gas industry. But many electric grid specialists, policy analysts and state politicians themselves said they've failed to do enough to prevent another blackout disaster., After a decade of warnings, a weak mandate to ""winterize"", Ever since another major freeze and blackout 10 years ago, experts have said Texas needed to ""winterize"" or ""weatherize"" not only its power plants but its oil and gas infrastructure as well. The reason is that cold weather can freeze wellheads and other components in the natural gas supply chain, stopping gas from getting to power plants., Despite February's deadly disaster, it was not clear that would happen this time either. Industry lobbyists, and regulators often seen as cozy with them, rejected winterization., Christi Craddick, the elected Republican chair of the state's oil and gas regulatory agency, the Railroad Commission of Texas, even denied the large role oil and gas failures played in the blackout., ""My industry resolved the problem and didn't really create it,"" she told lawmakers soon after the blackout., Given such pushback, it was a big deal when state Rep. Chris Paddie, a Republican from Marshall, managed to get a sweeping blackout response bill through the Texas House of Representatives. The legislation, known as Senate Bill 3, now awaits Gov. Greg Abbott's signature., ""It is the bill that addresses those fundamental issues that we identified early on ... with oversight, accountability, communication failures and weatherization,"" Paddie said as he brought the bill for an initial vote., That weatherization part of Senate Bill 3 allows regulators to determine which parts of the natural gas supply chain are critical to electricity production and then requires that they be protected from the cold., Most agree it is progress. But it only applies to equipment linked directly to power plants. Experts said it ignores the interconnectedness of the gas infrastructure., People wait in line to fill propane tanks in February in Houston. Power grid problems left millions weathering conditions in the dark in uninsulated homes, intensifying the Texas winter storm's deadliness. David J. Phillip/AP hide caption, People wait in line to fill propane tanks in February in Houston. Power grid problems left millions weathering conditions in the dark in uninsulated homes, intensifying the Texas winter storm's deadliness., ""What I fear, that it's just not going to be enough,"" said Dan Cohan, a professor of civil engineering at Rice University., He said if there's another big freeze, ""whoever has those direct lines into the power plants and winterizes those is going to point upstream and say, 'Well, those upstream people couldn't get us enough gas.' So yeah, it's hard to see how this is going to provide us full coverage."", The law also includes penalties as low as $5,000 a day for companies that do not winterize. Critics said those fines could cost less than the price of complying with the law., Doug Lewin, president of the consulting firm Stoic Climate and Energy, said that ""$5,000 for a big oil and gas company, to say it's a rounding error is probably an overstatement."", After the blackout, analysts at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said one simple way to build resilience into the natural gas supply chain would be to mandate weatherization of new gas wells built in Texas., Lewin points out that the state Legislature failed to act on that recommendation., Lawmakers took a pass on major market reforms, Other major proposals that might help safeguard the grid in both winter and in summer hardly received a hearing. That's likely, critics said, because these plans could threaten the profits of natural gas suppliers or electric generators., Suggestions to encourage power plants to have emergency backup fuel were rarely discussed. Bills to increase energy efficiency standards to relieve pressure on the grid were voted down. A proposal to back up the Texas grid by connecting it to other parts of the country was also not addressed., Jim Boyle, a former public counsel at the Public Utility Commission of Texas, thinks the Texas energy industry may have derailed some of these measures because they would reduce its market power over the grid., ""I think oil and gas interests think, 'Man, that doesn't sound too good to me!' "" said Boyle, who now works as an attorney., In Texas' deregulated energy market, companies can make more money during a blackout when supplies of gas or electricity are tight and demand is high. Many said until that basic fact is resolved, the state will remain vulnerable to blackouts., ""However the market is structured, that's going to drive what happens with the building of generation, the weatherization and sustainability of that generation, the cost of it to the consumer,"" said state Rep. Donna Howard, a Democrat from Austin., Howard and other lawmakers expect they will be asked by House and Senate leadership to study and hold committee hearings on electric market reform for potential action during the next regular legislative session in 2023., An alert system, and a crackdown on price spikes, Despite the shortcomings Howard sees in the blackout response, she said she believes lawmakers ""made some steps forward"" this legislative session., In addition to mandating the winterization of power plants, new legislation establishes an energy alert system to warn Texans of a potential grid emergency. It also cracks down on retail electric plans that tie the price customers pay to the spot market price of electricity., After the blackout many customers with such plans received electric bills for thousands of dollars because of price spikes during the crisis., Specific reforms such as these had such widespread support that Senate Bill 3 passed both chambers of the Legislature without a single vote against it., State Rep. Jon Rosenthal, a Houston Democrat who also works as an engineer in the gas industry, supported the bill because he liked some of its provisions but said, ""It's just not enough."", ""In the end,"" Rosenthal said, ""the product that came out of this body is not strong enough to ensure that we won't have another catastrophic event."", There's a chance such an event might come soon. Summer is the time of year when Texas usually uses the most energy, and some analysts said the state's grid runs the risk of yet another blackout in the coming months.",Climate

Katie Hobbs: addressing the drought,Kirk Siegler,"Arizona is one of the fastest growing states in the country. But a 23-year-long megadrought means it's now facing a reckoning over water that could derail its booming economy. It's now seeing more cuts in water from the shrinking Colorado River than any other state. Arizona's new Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, says overuse of that river is the challenge of our time. My administration has a lot of priorities, but none of it matters if we run out of water. NPR's Kirk Siegler spoke with Governor Hobbs about the state's water crisis, and he joins me now from Phoenix. Hey, Kirk. Hey, Ailsa. OK. So it sounds like Hobbs is taking office during this time when Arizona is sort of at this tipping point because this megadrought, it's threatening the economic and housing boom, especially in Phoenix where you are. What is she planning to do about it exactly? Well, Ailsa, this is Arizona, so let's start with the politics. Hobbs says her predecessor, Republican Governor Doug Ducey, was hiding the seriousness of this drought. She recently just made public a report that shows there's a lot less groundwater in the Phoenix area than people want to acknowledge. Like, when you drive out into the sprawling West Valley here, you see housing development after housing development still going up despite the megadrought. You know, it doesn't look like a place that's about to run out of water. But Hobbs told me there just isn't enough water to sustain all this growth. And for too long, Arizona politicians, in her mind, haven't been straight with the public about how dire the situation really is. I just think there was a lack of real, I guess, honesty with the people of Arizona about the situation we're in and just kind of wanting to say, oh, we have enough water, we're fine. And that's really not the case. If we don't take action now, we won't have enough water. Is there a point where we have to say that we can't grow anymore in this state? There might be. I don't think we're there yet. But I think if we don't really address these issues head on, look at the reality of the situation with water, look at how quickly we're growing, then we will get to that point. And I understand that Governor Hobbs - I mean, one of the things that she wants to do is try and modernize Arizona's groundwater laws, which are now, like - what? - 40 years old. That sounds kind of daunting, though, to just change the laws, right? It is, especially in the West when we're talking Western water law. But there is some support for this, I'm hearing, you know, to align these laws with the new drier reality we're facing. But it is a daunting task. But, you know, there's an acknowledgment that you, you know, can't maybe have so much uncontrolled growth or farmers can't keep growing so many thirsty crops like cotton and alfalfa in the desert. You know, Ailsa, what's been happening here as Arizona's Colorado River water deliveries are cut, farmers and cities are just resorting to pumping more water out of the aquifer. And Arizona has been pretty progressive with storing a lot of water in the aquifer, especially its Colorado River water, in the ground anticipating this very day. But, you know, climate change is just accelerating this, and it's colliding like we've been talking about with this huge population boom. Right. So I hear the governor saying, OK, it's time for her state to face this new reality. But, I mean, Arizona has pretty polarized politics. So how do you get everybody to face this reality together? That's an understatement. I mean, she's trying to focus on policy when the far-right Republicans in this state, let's be clear, are still focused on the election, claiming without any evidence that she was illegitimately installed as governor. You know, all politics is national. So you remember, Ailsa, her opponent, Kari Lake - well, she's right now traveling the country, making similar baseless claims, you know. Katie Hobbs told me this is all a big distraction. I mean, I don't pay attention to what my former opponent does. But what is a little daunting is the legislature that we have that has really, in these first few weeks of their session, kind of shown that they're not interested in working together. They were elected by the same people who elected me. And we have these tough challenges we have to come together to work on. So while they're focused on politics, Ailsa, you know, this megadrought is persisting despite some recent snow here and rain in Arizona. And the federal government could come in any day and mandate more and much bigger water cuts across the board. That is NPR's Kirk Siegler, joining us from Phoenix. Thank you, Kirk. Glad to be here.

Schmidt/Lawrence/AP hide caption, A robot nicknamed Icefin operates under the sea ice near McMurdo Station in Antarctica in 2020. The pencil-shaped robot is giving scientists their first look at the forces eating away at the Thwaites glacier., Scientists got their first up-close look at what's eating away part of Antarctica's Thwaites ice shelf, nicknamed the Doomsday Glacier because of its massive melt and sea rise potential, and it's both good and bad news., Using a 13-foot pencil-shaped robot that swam under the grounding line where ice first juts over the sea, scientists saw a shimmery critical point in Thwaites' chaotic breakup, ""where it's melting so quickly there, there's just material streaming out of the glacier,"" said robot creator and polar scientist Britney Schmidt of Cornell University., Before, scientists had no observations from this critical but hard-to-reach point on Thwaites. But with the robot named Icefin lowered down a slender 1,925-foot (587-meter) hole, they saw how important crevasses are in the fracturing of the ice, which takes the heaviest toll on the glacier, even more than melting. ""That's how the glacier is falling apart. It's not thinning and going away. It shatters,"" said Schmidt, lead author of one of two studies in Wednesday's journal Nature., That fracturing ""potentially accelerates the overall demise of that ice shelf,"" said Paul Cutler, the Thwaites program director for the National Science Foundation who returned from the ice last week. ""It's eventual mode of failure may be through falling apart."", The work comes out of a massive $50 million multi-year international research effort to better understand the widest glacier in the world. The Florida-sized glacier has gotten the nickname the ""Doomsday Glacier"" because of how much ice it has and how much seas could rise if it all melts — more than 2 feet (65 centimeters), though that's expected take hundreds of years., The melting of Thwaites is dominated by what's happening underneath, where warmer water nibbles at the bottom, something called basal melting, said Peter Davis, an oceanographer at British Antarctic Survey who is a lead author of one of the studies., ""Thwaites is a rapidly changing system, much more rapidly changing than when we started this work five years ago and even since we were in the field three years ago,"" said Oregon State University ice researcher Erin Pettit, who wasn't part of either study. ""I am definitely expecting the rapid change to continue and accelerate over the next few years."", Pennsylvania State University glaciologist Richard Alley, who also wasn't part of the studies, said the new work ""gives us an important look at processes affecting the crevasses that might eventually break and cause loss of much of the ice shelf."", A robot nicknamed Icefin is deployed at Thwaites glacier in Antarctica in January 2020. Two studies published Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2023, show the rate of melting isn't as fast as feared, but fracturing is taking the heaviest toll on the glacier. Dichek/AP hide caption, A robot nicknamed Icefin is deployed at Thwaites glacier in Antarctica in January 2020. Two studies published Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2023, show the rate of melting isn't as fast as feared, but fracturing is taking the heaviest toll on the glacier., The good news: Much of the flat underwater area they explored is melting much slower than they expected. The bad news: That doesn't really change how much ice is coming off the land part of the glacier and driving up sea levels, Davis said., Davis said the melting isn't nearly the problem at Thwaites that glacier retreat is. The more the glacier breaks up or retreats, the more ice floats in water. When ice is on ground as part of the glacier it isn't part of sea rise, but when it breaks off land and then goes onto water it adds to the overall water level by displacement, just as ice added to a glass of water raises water level., And more bad news: This is from the eastern, larger and more stable part of Thwaites. Researchers couldn't safely land a plane and drill a hole in the ice in the main trunk, which is breaking up much faster. And they also found staircase-like steps, those crevasses, in parts of the more stable eastern side where the break-up is far faster and worse., The key to seeing exactly how bad conditions are on the glacier would require going to the main trunk and looking at the melting from below. But that would require a helicopter to land on the ice instead of a heavier airplane and would be incredibly difficult, said studies co-author Eric Rignot of the University of California Irvine., The main trunk's glacier surface ""is so messed up by crevasses it looks like a set of sugar cubes almost. There's no place to land a plane,"" NSF's Cutler said., Ted Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, who wasn't part of the studies, said the results add to understanding how Thwaites is diminishing., ""Unfortunately, this is still going to be a major issue a century from now,"" Scambos said in an email. ""But our better understanding gives us some time to take action to slow the pace of sea level rise."", When the skinny robot wended its way through the hole in the ice – made by a jet of hot water – the cameras showed not just the melting water, the crucial crevasses and seabed. It showed critters, especially sea anemones, swimming under the ice., ""To accidentally find them here in this environment was really, really cool,"" Schmidt said in an interview. ""We were so tired that you kind of wonder like, 'am I really seeing what I'm seeing?' You know because there are these little creepy alien guys (the anemones) hanging out on the ice-ocean interface., ""In the background is like all these sparkling stars that are like rocks and sediment and things that were picked up from the glacier,"" Schmidt said. ""And then the anemones. It's really kind of a wild experience.""",Climate
https://www.npr.org/2023/02/15/1157274284/washington-states-push-to-reduce-emissions,2023-02-15,Washington state's push to reduce emissions,"Bellamy Pailthorp, John Ryan",": [POST- Colin Murphy is with the Low Carbon Fuel Policy Research Group at UC Davis. The audio story and transcript currently does not reflect the organization's full title.] Several states across the country have new laws on the books this year to reduce the greenhouse gas pollution that is warming the planet. Washington State is among them. New laws change how big businesses use energy and how people fuel up their cars and trucks. John Ryan from member station KUOW in Seattle begins this two-part story. A new cap on carbon emissions from big polluters is the centerpiece of Washington Governor Jay Inslee's push to tackle pollution that causes climate change. Inslee tooted his horn at a press conference in January. This is something we legitimately can crow about. We do have the best suite of policies to build clean energy in our state in the United States. The carbon cap has been in the works for about a decade. During that time, greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase. That's despite Inslee's promises and a state law that required emissions to shrink below their 1990 levels by the year 2020. Washington missed that deadline, and now the state mandate is to get to net-zero pollution over the next 30 years. And now we can show them real results - not just promises of action. Now, big polluters face a cap on their emissions. To keep polluting, businesses can buy a limited number of allowances - basically, pollution permits. Those permits will go on auction starting this month. Proceeds will go to reduce pollution and help hard-hit communities prepare for everything from heat waves to floods. The carbon cap is definitely a major system change for the economy in Washington. Jessica Spiegel represents oil companies like Chevron and Phillips 66 with the Western States Petroleum Association. Oil refineries won't have to make immediate pollution reductions like other sectors, due to fears they might take their business elsewhere. And they get their pollution permits, worth millions of dollars, for free. Even so, Spiegel says they'll be hard-pressed to cut pollution as fast as the state wants them to. How do we get there so fast? We need to be building new things right now. The BP refinery north of Bellingham is the second-biggest source of carbon pollution in the state. Refinery manager Eric Zimpfer says it's making more biodiesel and taking other steps to cut emissions faster than the state mandate. We're going to be a net-zero company across our operations. This is something the world needs to move to. A dozen eastern states have a cap on carbon emissions from power plants. But so far, only the West Coast states of California, Oregon and Washington have started to cap pollution from industry more broadly. For NPR News, I'm John Ryan in Seattle. This new carbon cap isn't Washington's only effort to cut emissions. This year, the state became the latest to adopt a low-carbon fuel standard. Bellamy Pailthorp with member station KNKX reports it's a system of fees on transportation fuel producers and credits for low-carbon alternatives. Tom Yamada drags a big hose from his bright orange tanker truck to a grease trap out back of a popular Hawaiian taco restaurant in Seattle. And it's like a big straw, so we're going to vacuum up this oil. He works for Mahoney Environmental, which recycles used cooking oil. Yamada says it's a dirty job, but he takes pride in helping to make cleaner fuels. There that goes. That was about 150 gallons. So it took maybe 2 minutes? Yamada collects cooking oil from all around western Washington. That oil then gets purified and pretreated in Seattle before it goes overseas, where it's processed into renewable diesel. The fuel isn't available in Washington yet - only abroad and in California and Oregon. They're actually able to get a lot higher price for renewable diesel in states that have a clean fuel standard. That's Leah Missik with Climate Solutions, a nonprofit that fought hard to get this fuel policy for Washington. The fees support low-carbon transportation alternatives like biofuels, but also electrification. Missik says transit agencies that provide vehicle chargers, for example, can get paid for every kilowatt-hour used. That can then be used by the transit agency to purchase more electric buses and convert their diesel fleet or install charging for more electric buses at their depots. In California, at times, those fees have largely offset the cost of the electricity used for some transit agencies, says Colin Murphy. He's with the Carbon Fuel Policy Research Group at UC Davis. He thinks Washington's new policy will add up to 10 cents a gallon to fuel prices over the next five years, but he says the benefits far outweigh the costs. It's - do we want to pay for lower-carbon fuels and energy, or do we want to keep rebuilding, you know, rural communities when they burn down due to wildfires and rebuilding coastal communities when they flood due to sea level rise? With Washington's policy now in effect, it joins the entire West Coast and British Columbia, Canada, with a fuel standard. Other states, including New York, New Mexico and Minnesota, have also tried to get one, but so far have hit roadblocks.For NPR News, I'm Bellamy Pailthorp in Seattle. ",Climate

Weather forecasters know how to steer clear,Mallika Seshadri,".S. Air Force member releases a weather balloon from the deck of the U.S.S. Portland off the coast of Baja California, Mexico, in December 2022. Caroline Brehman/AP hide caption, .S. Air Force member releases a weather balloon from the deck of the U.S.S. Portland off the coast of Baja California, Mexico, in December 2022., Balloon concerns have the U.S. military now looking at a lot of what an assistant secretary of defense has called ""low speed clutter"" in America's skies., The National Weather Service, which launches about 184 balloons every day across the country, says they make sure they and aviation authorities know where all of them are at all times., These balloons allow weather forecasters to predict upcoming trends and future storms. Some even give researchers measures of pollutants. And to make sure their balloons aren't mistaken for clutter, the National Weather Service uses a GPS to track each one and notifies the Federal Aviation Administration before each launch – many of which take place at airports., ""Balloons were one of the first tools used to collect environmental data, dating back to the 1700s,"" National Weather Service spokesperson Susan Buchanan says. ""Our balloons provide valuable atmospheric data used to produce weather forecasts."", So far, all National Weather Service balloons have been accounted for, according to Buchanan., ""None of the objects that were shot down were NWS balloons, as none of our balloons are missing,"" she says., The U.S. has shot down three unidentified aerial vehicles since Feb. 4 – in addition to a balloon the State Department says is part of a ""fleet"" of Chinese military balloons. One of the remaining unidentified aerial vehicles was shot down because of potential surveillance concerns, while the remaining two were seen as threatening to civilian flight in the U.S. and Canada., The possibility of the United States shooting down more unidentified aerial vehicles hasn't spurred much concern at the National Weather Service., That's because they communicate with the Federal Aviation Administration before each launch – on top of GPS tracking each balloon once it drifts into the sky., ""Most of our upper air balloon launch sites are co-located with airports. For these sites, we call the FAA tower before we launch our morning and evening balloons,"" Buchanan says. ""Some others that are not located near airports (Miami is an example) also call the local FAA tower before each launch."", The National Weather Service also tries to keep the public informed of its launches and teach about the balloons., ""We use every opportunity to provide public outreach and education about our balloons,"" Buchanan says. ""We particularly focus education on what to do when the public finds a radiosonde that has parachuted back to earth so they aren't alarmed by it."", A radiosonde is an instrument that measures temperature, pressure and relative humidity amid extreme cold and nearly 200 mph winds., Composed of latex and synthetic rubber, National Weather Service balloons are filled with helium, and expand as they ascend to almost 100,000 feet – growing from six feet in diameter to about 20. Once in the air, the balloons can travel as far as 125 miles over the course of about two hours., And the process of tracking radiosondes can send even more information to the ground, says Russell Dickerson, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the University of Maryland who has participated in launches., ""As they drift with the wind, the location is radioed back to the Earth's surface and we can determine the winds,"" he says, noting that launches led by people and organizations outside the National Weather Service are also responsible for notifying the Federal Aviation Administration., Once the balloons burst, a parachute gently sends the radiosonde back to Earth. These cheap packages, he says, are smaller than a large bird and are ""basically throwaways,"" designed to not damage airplanes if there's a collision., Around the world, forecasters launch balloons from about 900 locations that ""give us a synopsis of the weather on a global scale,"" and some even measure smog and pollution, according to Dickerson., In addition to regular weather balloons, there are other types of balloons in the sky that examine the upper atmosphere and stratosphere, which extends from about 6.2 miles to about 31 miles. But they're ""usually announced well in advance,"" Dickerson says., There are also balloons launched by NASA that measure ozone, which protects the Earth from above but is also a greenhouse gas closer to home., ""[Ozone] has a good side and bad side, like the force,"" says Dickerson, who says he would hate to see those balloons destroyed. ""It's good up there, but not down here.""",National Security

But the companies that pump those fossil fuels aren't exactly racing to get out of the business. In fact, they made huge profits last year by staying the course and sticking with oil. And some companies that had planned to make so-called green pivots are slowing down. NPR's Camila Domonoske joins us to talk about what this means for the world. Hey, Camila. Hi, Ailsa. OK, so what is going on with oil companies and these so-called plans to invest in renewables? Yeah, let's talk about BP because this made some headlines. BP had a plan to shift from being an oil company to an energy company, and it did actually invest some money in renewable energy. But last week, they announced a shift in strategy, at least somewhat, slowing down the timeline for reducing oil production. I mean, they're putting more money into oil and natural gas this decade than they had been planning to do.Now, to be sure, lots of oil companies never had any plan to pivot to renewables in the first place. And those that did, there were lots of concerns about greenwashing or very small investments relative to oil. But where there was appetite to do this in the oil industry, there are indications that it's dropping. The consulting firm Accenture did surveys several times with oil companies asking, hey, are you planning to radically reinvent your business model? And last year, the number of companies that said yes actually dropped by half. Wait, wait, why? Well, one obvious point - the demand for oil is there, right? Yeah. The world uses huge quantities of oil and natural gas today, every single day. And when oil prices are high, like they were last year, pumping oil is incredibly profitable. So to go back to BP, its big plan was to invest in renewable energy, but its renewable projects just haven't made as much money as oil and natural gas make. So the stock market punished BP for leaving money on the table. The stock really struggled. Dan Pickering is an energy investor and an analyst. The market is a moneymaking animal. And so when they said we're going to spend a little bit more in oil and gas, the market applauded that. That is to say BP's stock went up after this announcement that investors interpreted as being a recommitment to oil and gas. OK, I get it. In the short term, oil is profitable, but what does this mean for the future? Like, do oil companies think the world will just go on using oil and gas indefinitely? Yeah. What I think is really interesting, right now, even oil executives are talking a lot about an energy transition, the idea that the world will shift away from oil and gas. That's really different than just a few years ago, right? They talk about climate change a lot. But when it comes to the idea of shifting away from oil and gas, there is a major disagreement on the timing, with the oil industry arguing that this will take a very long time.So on the one hand, you have an idea of a very rapid transition, reducing emissions as quickly as possible, which is still a couple of decades but just a couple of decades, right? That would be expensive and disruptive. It would mean higher energy bills for people today, but it would save money and save human lives in the future by reducing climate impacts more. On the other hand, you have a more gradual transition, a slower change that releases a lot more CO2. It would be cheaper and easier. Today, it would obviously be more profitable for oil companies, but it would mean a much bigger price paid in the future. Sure. So based on investments, right now, oil companies are betting on a slow change. Well, what does that mean for efforts to fight climate change then? This is a bet. It could be right or wrong. It depends on how fast demand actually goes down. On that point, you know, today, European lawmakers put the finishing touches on a law that would ban the sale of new gas-powered cars in 2035. There's the same in California. That's right. So things change fast sometimes, but it's not clear who's going to be right in this question about the future. That is NPR's Camila Domonoske. Thank you, Camila. Thank you. ",Business

Because people often ask me, like, ""Where can I read? What can I read? What can I watch? I want to get more engaged with the climate crisis. I want to become an activist. I want to learn. But I don't know where to start."" So this is a very good place to start. I think it covers a lot of issues concerning the climate crisis. So it's not just a one-sided story., On if the United States has stepped up in the way that it needs to, I wouldn't say in the way that it needs to. We might see some improvements in some areas, but still, the U.S. is expanding fossil fuel infrastructure. And to do that at a time right now where countless people are losing their lives and livelihoods in a climate emergency that is just continuing to escalate every day. I think that's very, very irresponsible and it's completely absurd., On how to overcome the political realities of a divided government, That's exactly the reason why the politicians and the people in power need to start speaking up. Because as it is now, they might not have the votes, they might not have the public support from voters to actually take these measures. And of course, how can we expect that? How can we expect people to demand drastic change in order to safeguard our present and future living conditions if they don't know the reason why those changes are needed., Right now it's like, saving the climate is seen as an act of tree hugging. It's not being seen as a way to protect our civilization as we know it and to save countless human lives. That is being put against jobs and workers, when it's actually the opposite., The fight for social justice is the fight for climate justice. We can't have one without the other. We can't put them against each other. And unless people know that – unless people know how bad the situation actually is — they're not going to demand change because they're going to want to keep things the way they are., I believe that the changes will come from the outside, people demanding this, because we see that when there have been successful campaigns. People are raising these issues in a way [that's] been working then that has also had effects on the policies that are being made and the decisions that are being made., And then, of course, I think that I'm not the one to tell the U.S. how they should do things when it comes to things like Congress and so on. I think that's more up to the experts and the people there., On whether she will pursue a career in politics, I really hope not. [laughs] I mean, politics as it is now is very, very toxic. And it doesn't seem like the kind of world I would want to spend my life in. I think that I can do more as a campaigner on the outside., Thunberg at a Fridays for Future global climate strike in Berlin in 2021. Markus Schreiber/AP hide caption, Thunberg at a Fridays for Future global climate strike in Berlin in 2021., On her experience as an international celebrity, Of course, I don't think it's what anyone expected or could ever expect. So I guess I just have to use the advantage that that gives me. It gives me a platform [where] I can speak up about things that can impact things, people, etc. But of course, it sends a weird message that we are focusing sometimes on specific individuals rather than the actual problem itself and rather than the people actually suffering the consequences of that problem., On finishing high school and managing a busy schedule, I don't know, [laughs] to be honest. I don't have an answer to that., On if it's overwhelming, Maybe yes, overwhelming. But I think what's more is the feeling of doing something that matters. Doing something that has an impact.

When it's cold enough, they pour water over the ice that's already on the canal, so it'll freeze and make the ice thicker. We're still - we're very positive. You see, last week we had -40, -29, so we water it every evenings. And so it's - we've got some good ice, but it's not skateable at the moment. He says he misses skating on the canal. The joy of seeing all the smiles on people's face, enjoying their time and others learning how to skate. And it's a great feeling to be out there and see the immensity of the ice and how long it is. They're working hard to try to get at least one section of the canal opened up before winter is over. But Devine says the canal usually closes by late February or early March, so time is running out. For now, people have to settle for artificial rinks, like the one on the plaza right outside Ottawa City Hall. Julia Daniel is here giving her friend Nikita Nineza a lesson. You might want to lean on one foot, and then go out. Two of their other friends are zooming right behind them. One guy stumbles. He grabs the other guy's arm. And...(LAUGHTER) They land right on top of each other. The canal is just steps away. You can see the tops of its walls from the rink. This kind of fun skating action should be happening there. I feel like it's kind of, like, a Canadian bucket list item, and I came all this way to not do it because it's a record-breaking year. I'm so sad. That's Alex Jones. They came all the way from the Northwest Territory for a national climate conference. And one of their friends who's from Ontario really sold them on this Canadian dream. Skating along the canal, there's the warming huts. You can buy a beaver tail. I had visions of, you know, double-fisting beaver tail in one hand, hot chocolate in the other hand, just skating the full 7 1/2 kilometers or so of the canal. For the uninitiated, a beaver tail is a flat piece of hot fried dough covered in sugar. Skating the canal was actually one of the planned activities for the climate conference, but the canal didn't freeze enough, as it has every other winter since 1971 when it was opened for skating for the first time. Jones has given up on it this winter. It's not going to be thick enough. It's not going to freeze. But at least one part of the Ottawa winter fantasy can still come true.Oh, my God. (Laughter). Fried dough, right? Oh, my God. It's so good. It's where it's at. The beaver tail. We'll always have fried dough. For NPR News, I'm Lucy Grindon in Ottawa. ",Climate

KQED climate reporter Ezra David Romero visits a recently flooded neighborhood where residents are looking for a lasting fix. Antonio Lopez walks a recently flooded neighborhood in East Palo Alto, about half an hour south of San Francisco along the bay. A pump removes water from a parking garage that San Francisquito Creek turned into a lake. A New Year's Eve storm dropped nearly four inches of rain, engorging the creek. Floodwaters poured into the community. Around two dozen cars were swamped. But the ones you see here, I can almost guarantee you they're totaled. They can't be moved because the water hit their motor. Lopez is the city's vice mayor. He helped a woman frantically trying to get into her car the day of the flood. It was heartbreaking, man - trying to salvage her possessions from her car because the water came up all the way to the window. Early estimates put the damage at more than $100,000. Statewide, the economic losses from flooding are estimated between 5 and $7 billion. That's according to Moody's RMS, which models global catastrophe risk and solutions. President Joe Biden visited the region in mid-January to tour flooded communities. In the San Francisco Bay Area, I've instructed my administration to bring every element of the federal government together with the help of immediate needs to long-term rebuilding. Federal disaster assistance is available for nine California counties, including San Mateo, where East Palo Alto is. In East Palo Alto, community organizer Marisela Ramos leads an effort to get outside aid to help pay for local damages. (Speaking Spanish). She says the totaled cars were many residents' primary mode of transportation to get to their jobs, to generate money, to pay rent and to buy food for their kids. (Speaking Spanish). San Francisquito Creek has flooded many times. A new study out last month in the journal Nature Climate Change projects the most extreme winter storms will only get more intense. Study co-author Ruby Leung is with the U.S. Pacific Northwest National Lab. Assuming we continue to use fossil energy in a similar way, we project about 30% increase in the total precipitation. But such number could be reduced if we can do something about it. She says all that water can strain or even break through levees, like floodwaters did in Monterey County last month. The information that we used before to design the infrastructure may not be relevant anymore, and we need to incorporate knowledge that we now have about how the future may be changing. In East Palo Alto, city and regional leaders have already been working on a long-term fix to allow more water to flow from San Francisquito Creek to the bay. They have long had plans to build a new bridge and deepen and widen the creek channel. We know we can't completely do away with the risk of flooding. Margaret Bruce leads the effort. She's the executive director of the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority. The plan is to protect the community from future catastrophic flood events. We can no longer plan our future looking in the rearview mirror. Bruce says it will cost at least $50 million. State or federal infrastructure money could help. Otherwise, San Mateo County, East Palo Alto and nearby cities like Palo Alto and Menlo Park are on the hook to finish it. Instead of having the creek as the boundary, the creek has ended up being the thing that joins the counties in these three cities. If funded, the creek restoration could be completed as soon as next year.For NPR News, I'm Ezra David Romero in East Palo Alto. ",Climate

But there are doubts about the deal because — for one thing — the country is planning to build new coal plants, including here in Kalimantan. Adek Berry/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, Not far from the white sand beaches on the island of Borneo, the Indonesian government is building what it calls a ""green industrial park."" In the ground-breaking ceremony, Indonesia's president said this area of more than 40,000 acres would become a hub for green manufacturing using the country's vast mineral reserves., Indonesian officials are pursuing deals with Chinese battery manufacturer CATL as well as Elon Musk and Tesla to make EV batteries there. The idea is that this ""green"" park will eventually run on solar power and hydropower from a nearby river., But building the hydropower infrastructure could take several years. In the meantime, Indonesia plans to build new coal-fired plants to power its ""green"" park, says Rachmat Kaimuddin, Deputy Minister of Indonesia's Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment., Running green tech factories on brand new coal plants captures the often contradictory push-and-pull of Indonesia's approach to climate change. Now these inconsistencies are raising questions as Indonesia emerges as an ambitious test case of a developing nation getting billions from industrialized countries to get off fossil fuels., In November 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and other world leaders announced an initial $20 billion deal to help Indonesia get off coal power. About 60% of the country's electricity comes from coal. Reining in global warming requires cutting fossil fuel use, especially coal, the single largest energy source of planet-heating carbon dioxide., The deal would rely on loans, grants and other financial tools from countries like the U.S. and Japan, as well as banks like Citigroup and Bank of America, to help Indonesia retire coal plants early and increase renewable energy. Some analysts hope it could be a model to get other developing countries off coal-fired electricity., But Indonesian energy experts and solar executives worry much of this deal may be ""omong kosong"" — empty talk. They say despite Indonesia's renewable aspirations, the country has many coal-friendly policies which this deal might not address, including an exemption to build more coal plants., The credibility issues of this deal could cast doubt on future international efforts to get other countries off coal, says Anissa Suharsono, a Jakarta-based energy analyst at the think tank the International Institute for Sustainable Development. ""If the government cares about international image, then they better make sure this one doesn't fall apart,"" she says., Indonesia gets less than 1% of its energy from solar — about 60% from coal. The deal has a target to double the country's renewables by 2030, but many solar executives aren't optimistic, because of coal subsidies and a potential loophole to build more coal plants. Aditya Irawan/NurPhoto via Getty Images hide caption, Emerging economies continue to use coal to fuel their development. But industrialized countries hope an influx of funding could speed up the transition to renewables. World leaders already invested in a similar ""Just Energy Transition Partnership"" in South Africa. The goal is not just to do deals one country at a time, but make a template for wider adoption across the world, says Camilla Fenning of the climate and energy research group E3G., Indonesia, the world's largest exporter of coal for electricity, has more coal power than it can use. Indonesia made bad projections about rising power demand over the last decade, and built too many coal plants on islands like Java, Kaimuddin says. ""And you can't just say, 'Sorry, we don't want to do it anymore.'"", The $20 billion deal could enable Indonesia to retire those coal plants early without as much economic pain, says Kaimuddin, whose ministry is leading negotiations. ""Instead of operating for X amount of years, we reduce it by 5 years, by 10 years,"" he says., But there are questions about how fast Indonesia's transition off coal will be, in part because of a potential loophole to allow the country to build even more coal plants. ""You're paying this country to shut down some coal power plants while [it's] also still building new ones? That just, it just doesn't make sense,"" Suharsono says., ""You're paying this country to shut down some coal power plants while [it's] also still building new ones? That just, it just doesn't make sense."", Anissa Suharsono, Not long before Indonesia signed the deal, Indonesia's president made a commitment to stop developing new coal plants. But the new regulation includes an exemption to build coal plants if they are already in the pipeline or attached to nationally strategic projects like the green park in Indonesian Borneo. ""They keep saying 'no new coal, no new coal, no new coal,'"" Suharsono says. ""It's like they put that clause there to give a loophole."", As the country plans new industrial parks to take advantage of its huge nickel reserves, a key component for batteries and EVs, the exemption for new coal plants should raise alarm bells, says Flora Champenois, coal research analyst at Global Energy Monitor, a climate data organization. ""The nickel industry is booming in Indonesia,"" she says. ""That can't be powered by coal to meet climate goals."", Kaimuddin's office notes that new coal plants linked to strategic projects must shut down by 2050 and reduce emissions by 35% within 10 years through technology or carbon offsets. Experts say there is no good way to know if carbon offsets really work. And the International Energy Agency recently reaffirmed that to keep warming less than 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid the worst effects of climate change, there must be ""no new development of unabated coal-fired power plants."", John Kerry, U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, said in an emailed statement, ""Indonesia made these commitments not only to combat the climate crisis, but also to transform and grow their economy, ​​and the Just Energy Transition Partnership is squarely focused on supporting Indonesia's aspirations."", Overshadowing Indonesia's energy transition are links between the country's political establishment and the coal industry, says Putra Adhiguna, analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a nonprofit think tank., The green park that plans to build new coal plants is a project of coal billionaire Garibaldi Thohir, whose brother, Erick Thohir, is Minister of State Owned Enterprises. And the official running the deal to get off coal, Luhut Pandjaitan, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment, has coal assets himself. Indonesians worry there might be political conflicts of interest over which coal plants get shut down, which still get to operate, and which new ones get built, Adhiguna says., Luhut Pandjaitan's office says in an email that ""transparency and accountability continue to be critical components of Indonesia's decarbonization efforts."" His deputy minister, Kaimuddin, adds: ""Pak Luhut is my direct supervisor, and I can say so far he's been very, very supportive of this decarbonization and never once he mentioned, like, you know, 'What about my asset?' or whatever."", U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen meets with Luhut Pandjaitan, Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment, in September 2022. Pandjaitan is running the deal to get Indonesia off coal. He also has coal assets himself. Jacquelyn Martin/AP hide caption, The new deal to get off coal includes an ambitious target: at least 34% of Indonesia's power coming from renewable sources by 2030. Now only about 12% of the grid comes from renewables, mostly hydropower and geothermal. Less than 1% of Indonesia's power comes from solar. The idea is that some part of the $20 billion could help build Indonesia's renewable sector., But NPR spoke to half a dozen Indonesian renewable energy executives and investors who worry that the country won't actually reduce the roadblocks that have in recent years kept more solar and wind from coming online., ""A lot of things that are appearing on the news and to the public can be quite different from what is being actually implemented,"" says Josh Ching, CEO of Solardex, an Indonesian solar company. While the Indonesian government says it wants to promote renewables, Ching says it also creates obstacles towards them being profitable., For example, the country has a price cap that keeps coal prices artificially low, says Fabby Tumiwa, executive director of the think tank the Institute for Essential Services Reform and chairman of the Indonesia Solar Energy Association. That makes things challenging for renewable energy producers who — in much of the country — have to sell power lower than the average price for electricity. ""It makes renewables actually very, very difficult,"" Tumiwa says. ""They cannot compete in the situation where coal is actually subsidized."", A statement from world leaders says Indonesia will phase down domestic coal subsidies. But Adhiguna says it's unclear what that means, especially as the country continues to find new ways to invest in domestic coal. Last year Indonesia and a Pennsylvania-based company began constructing a $2.3 billion facility to turn coal into gas for cooking, which, in addition to having high emissions, is expensive and requires subsidies, Tumiwa says., ""It's really important to keep an eye on phasing down coal power in the traditional sense, but also in the sort of emerging technology sense,"" Champenois says, ""There's sort of no such thing as clean coal."", As Indonesia and its international partners wrap up the first stage of the deal, Adhiguna says the government needs to start disclosing more details to the public, like the criteria around which coal plants get retired and which new ones get built., Ultimately Suharsono says the strongest message from the international community to help move Indonesia off coal would be for international banks to commit to not financing any of the country's new coal developments. ""If you wanna send a message, you want us to get off coal, stop funding us.""",Climate

From near and far, including a teacher from The Friends School of Atlanta who sent in her students' wishes, here's a selection of your thoughts., Submissions were edited for length and clarity., My dream for human kind is that people would stop trashing the ocean. -Mira, 1st Grade, My wish is that each child is taught the basics of ecology and our total reliance on natural systems. Many children have no idea where their water comes from or where their waste goes. Without a knowledgeable population, policies that benefit all of us are hard to achieve. -Jane Eller, retired director of the Kentucky Environmental Education Council, a state agency, My dream for humankind is for people to have peaceful days everyday in their souls. -Shannon, 1st grader, My wish is for the Russia/Ukrainian war to cease rapidly and diplomatically. Loss of lives, obliteration of dwellings, civic and cultural structures and the possibility of nuclear weapon usage has placed the world in peril. The billions of dollars spent should have gone to address climate change and global food insecurity. -Sarah Wright, retired pediatrician from Oregon, My wish for 2023 is that leaders of all countries could fly into orbit to view our planet from space. I am of the opinion that this experience would have a profound impact on each leader and provide perspective on priorities. -Carter Alexander, Suwanee, Georgia, My wish for 2023 is that wherever you are, find win-win-win solutions to problems. Many people play win-lose games in all aspects of life without understanding what winning is or realizing more people are impacted than the two competitors. Sometimes simply being able to compete is a win. Many are not so lucky. Children are always watching. If they observe us creating win-win-win solutions without demeaning ""losers"" they will naturally want to do the same. -Joel Stegner, retired market research director, Edina, Minn., First graders at The Friends School of Atlanta wish for kindness and peace in 2023. The Friends School of Atlanta hide caption, My dream for humankind is for everybody to have peace in their family. A kind family would be kind to their children and help them to be kind to others. -Seva, 1st grade, My wish is that gun violence can be prevented. While the U.S. is an outlier in unsafe gun laws, the problem of gun violence is global. My son often tries to imagine his 11-year-old life in a place without the threat of gun violence, and it breaks my heart that he may never have that experience. -Kelsey Power, owner of Charleston Power Family Garden, a mini orchard and market garden in St. Louis, Mo., My wish for 2023 is that we recognize that an 18-year-old person is not fully an adult except legally. While many of us know 18-year-olds who are quite mature, the human brain does not complete its neurological development until approximately age 25. One of the final brain regions to develop controls executive function – guiding decision-making and supporting the management of impulses. Yet, we in the U.S. subject 18-year-olds to an adult court jurisdiction in a criminal proceeding. An 18-year-old can get married, get a tattoo, donate blood, play the lottery or get involved in some forms of online gambling. They can enlist into military service and even go into the battlefield. When we let 18-year-olds help decide the outcome of a legal case for another person as a juror, we are putting decision-making into the hands of a person who cannot reliably avoid impulsive decisions. We let people who turn 18 buy firearms. Why are the rental car companies the only group to take into account this vital neurological fact? Is it because they have something valuable to protect? Don't we all? -Jill Pulley, executive director of the Vanderbilt Institute of Clinical and Translational Research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, My wish for 2023 is for global leaders to tackle the current education crisis and the impact it has on some of the world's most marginalized learners. This crisis has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, as many as 33 million children with disabilities were out of school, the majority in lower-income countries. These children, especially girls with disabilities, are less likely to go to school and more likely to be illiterate than children without disabilities. It would be great to see children with disabilities included in mainstream education and in data collection. This requires both funding and training educators. All of this work should be done with the input of those with lived experience of disability so their voices are heard. -Liesbeth Roolvink, deputy technical director for inclusive education at the international development organization Sightsavers, My dream for human kind is for everyone to have homes. The homes would be nice. And the homes would have all of the resources they need. -Francis, 1st grade, Housing is on the mind of one first grader at The Friends School of Atlanta. The Friends School of Atlanta. hide caption, My wish for 2023 is a forever home (a safe place to stay for the rest of their lives) for all the pets in the world, without risk of abuse. -Susie Lipton, a pediatric infectious disease specialist who lives on a small farm in Maryland, My wish is to put bureaucracy aside and take all those office buildings and parking garages that emptied out during the pandemic, all those malls that are foundering, barely surviving or are abandoned, all those high-rises with entire floors empty, all the blighted empty lots and long-abandoned structures — and house so many of those that are unhoused, all over the world. Provide a place in these structures for social services to help the unhoused find the services they need. -Genevieve Foskett, former librarian, Wisconsin, My wish is to have free electricity for all households. There is tremendous untapped solar potential across the world, enough to feed energy into the grid and provide low-cost electricity to businesses to offset the cost of transmission and maintenance. Creating free electricity for electric vehicle charging stations would eliminate the biggest hurdle to widespread adoption of electric vehicles. -Rick Palmeri, retired computer guy and full time dreamer, Connecticut, I hope that businesses can prioritize workplace health and safety. Every single day, 7,500 people die globally from unsafe and unhealthy working conditions. Working with governments, universities and other nonprofits, we can change the narrative by saving lives that otherwise would be lost or become non productive to society and the economy. -Bernard L. Fontaine, Jr., managing partner of The Windsor Consulting Group, Monroe, N.J., My wish for 2023 is for everyone to be treated with dignity, regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation or any other identity. Everyone has the right to be treated with dignity, and I strive to create an environment where this is the norm. I believe that creating a more equitable, peaceful and just world starts with how we treat one another. Dignity is integral to our sense of self-worth and self-respect. It is also essential for our relationships with others, allowing us to be seen and respected for who we are. -Immy Mulekatete, communications enthusiast with the United Nations Resident Coordinator's Office in Rwanda., Gisele Grayson and Carmen Drahl are freelance editors.

https://www.npr.org/2023/02/04/1154541830/a-meteorologist-explains-the-record-breaking-cold-snap-in-the-northeast,2023-02-04,A meteorologist explains the record-breaking cold snap in the Northeast,,"Over the past 24 hours, a dangerously cold storm has pushed temperatures well below zero across New England. Weather Service officials warned that these dangerously cold temperatures can cause frostbite on any exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes. And here's what that storm sounded like outside the Mount Washington Weather Observatory in New Hampshire's White Mountains. That wind you're hearing ripped across the summit of Mount Washington, which is the highest peak in the northeastern U.S., at 120 miles per hour. Wind chill temperatures were measured at below -100 degrees Fahrenheit, according to NASA. That's about the same temperature as the surface of Mars. And inside the observatory overnight and still there now is meteorologist Francis Tarasiewicz. He is a weather observer and education specialist with the Mount Washington Observatory. He's here to explain why this storm is so severe and what is causing this strange phenomena. Francis Tarasiewicz, thank you so much for joining us. Hi. Thank you for having me. So what are the conditions like outside, and what was it like over the past 24 hours? Sure. So outside right now, we've finally broken out of the clouds. We were in a lot of fog. And interestingly enough, we've been watching these little snow whirls, little snow tornadoes, if you will, coming up the side of the summit with strong winds. We're still in the 70 or so mile per hour range with gusts around 90 miles per hour. And we're the warmest we've been in over two days, almost, at 24 degrees below zero. So I would assume that Mount Washington in particular is no stranger to extreme conditions. But how does this compare with other cold snaps? So actually, this particular cold snap up here on the summit tied the record. Lowest temperature that we've recorded as an organization at this particular station - 47 degrees below zero. We hit that number right around 4:00 a.m. this morning. Oh, my goodness. So what's causing these incredibly cold temperatures in New England and where you are at Mount Washington? So there has been a lobe of the polar vortex, which usually sits right on the northern - right on the North Pole, I should say. That's come down from northern Canada and paid us a visit here up here in New England and, in particular, in the northern part of New England. That's really what allowed for a really quick-hitting but intense period of cold. Do you think that we are going to see more of these kinds of storms in the future? Difficult to say exactly, but there are some studies that suggest a wavier jet stream that is able to dislodge these areas of polar air southward into the mid-latitudes maybe contributing to future events like this, particularly as the planet warms and that temperature gradient from north to south lessens. That will allow for the jet stream to perhaps become a bit more wavy and, again, bring some of these chunks of really cold arctic air southward. On the one hand, it's fascinating, right? On the other hand, it's kind of frightening because it can be dangerous, these cold temperatures. I mean, human beings really aren't built for this. Am I right? That's absolutely right. So even right now, you know, the warmest we've been in 24 hours, if I were to, say, leave my glove off for more than a couple of minutes, I may start to feel the beginnings of frostbite. And yesterday, frostbite could have set in as little as 30 seconds or so, just, you know, 100-degree-below wind chill. And so definitely a quite dangerous storm up here and in the New England area overall. So I think the message here is don't be out there. I think that's kind of - I think the bottom line is don't be out there. But I - which is, I assume, one of the reasons school was closed is that people don't want children, you know, standing at bus stops and things of that sort. Definitely. I think that was the right call for many areas, many areas around the Northeast breaking record-low temperatures. During the month of February, that's a fairly impressive feat in New England. That was Francis Tarasiewicz. He's a weather observer and education specialist with the Mount Washington Observatory. Francis Tarasiewicz, thanks so much for talking to us. Thanks for your time.

Temperatures fell last night between 10 to 20 degrees below zero in much of Maine. Strong winds made it feel much colder. As Murray Carpenter reports from Maine Public Radio, the weather is leading to cancellations and warnings. The National Weather Service was predicting some of the coldest windchill temperatures in decades for much of Maine. This weekend, it's going to be wicked cold, probably the coldest we've seen in years. Dr. Michael Baumann is the chair of the emergency department at Maine Medical Center in Portland. Coupled with the wind chill, it's going to be really difficult on exposed skin. So it's going to be very easy to get frostbite this weekend, and if you're out for a prolonged period of time, to get hypothermia. The Maine Emergency Management Agency has posted a list of warming centers. And officials are encouraging people to keep pets inside and check on their neighbors. Sam Chamberlain works for Preble Street in Portland, which provides services for unhoused people. Chamberlain is encouraging people to use warming centers, and he's distributing cold weather gear for those who won't. We have a fair supply of sleeping bags and blankets and gloves and hats and clothes that we can distribute to folks that may choose to not enter a warming center this weekend. The weather's causing some Mainers to change their plans, even those who love cold weather. Randy Sullivan says he's a hardcore ice fisherman, and he's used to cold weather, but he's not fishing Saturday. With the negative temperatures like that, it can be tolerable, and when you add the wind to it, that's when it really becomes dangerous. I think I'll probably just stay right next to my woodstove. Some Maine ski areas are closed due to the cold. And at Camden Snow Bowl, the first day of the National Toboggan Championships is canceled. Mark McGowan came up from Connecticut for the race. So we're going to have to change our plans. And now it's going to be barhopping Friday, barhopping Saturday, tobogganing on Sunday.

https://www.npr.org/2023/02/04/1152080009/the-epa-is-updating-its-most-important-tool-for-cracking-down-on-carbon-emission,2023-02-04,The EPA is updating its most important tool for cracking down on carbon emissions,Rebecca Hersher,"The Environmental Protection Agency is updating its most important tool for trying to crack down on greenhouse gas emissions. That tool is a single number called the social cost of carbon. NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports the new number is simultaneously more accurate and an ethics nightmare. Imagine trying to add up all the human costs of emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere - the cost of lost crops and flooded homes and lost wages when people can't safely work outside, plus the cost of climate-related deaths. That is basically how the EPA figures out the social cost of carbon. And right now the official number is $51. The EPA wants to increase that to $190. Daniel Hemel is a law professor at New York University. So going from $51 to $190 - that's a move in the right direction. The right direction, because most climate experts agree that the current number is too low. It underestimates the human cost of greenhouse gas emissions. A higher number would make it easier to do expensive things that cut emissions. For example, replacing all of America's power plants with renewable energy right away - that would be expensive. If the benefits to humanity are paltry, maybe it doesn't make sense. But if the benefits to humanity are really big then the government should do it. At least that's the idea. Tamma Carleton is a climate economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She says the social cost of carbon is the single most powerful climate policy tool that the federal government has. So we don't have other avenues for large-scale climate policy at the federal level. This is our main tool. But the new number is controversial because of how the EPA is thinking about the lives that are lost from climate change. Noah Kaufman is a climate economist at Columbia University. The question is how to put a value on those deaths. Like, a dollar value - basically, how much is a life worth? Now, the EPA says on its website that they are not putting a dollar amount on human life. Instead, the agency says it, quote, ""uses estimates of how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in their risks of dying."" The EPA declined to answer NPR's questions for this story. Hemel says, in reality, the EPA's social cost of carbon does put a dollar amount on human lives. You'll hear agencies say, we're not valuing lives. I don't know. They kind of are. They're deciding how much it's worth it to spend in order to save a life. And because climate change is global, they're thinking about lives all around the world for the first time. That's one reason the new social cost of carbon number is higher. But not every death is being counted equally. The EPA uses higher dollar amounts for deaths in higher-income countries and lower dollar amounts for deaths in lower-income countries. Or, as Paul Kelleher, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin, puts it... The badness of a death from climate change in India is treated as not as bad as exactly the same death if it happened at exactly the same time in the United States. According to the EPA's calculations, one climate-related death in the U.S. has about as much value as nine deaths in India, or five deaths in Ukraine, or 55 deaths in Somalia. Vaibhav Chaturvedi is a climate economist at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, an influential climate think tank in New Delhi, India. Anybody in the developing world would kind of probably think in this kind of way. It is inherently inequitable to use this sort of approach. Chaturvedi says the U.S. government should put the same value on every life, morally, but also logically, because America's greenhouse gas emissions endanger people everywhere, and especially in low-lying and low-income countries where people are more vulnerable to rising seas and extreme weather. Hemel, the law professor, agrees. I think we send a problematic message to Americans when we use a method for assigning values to lives outside the United States that ends up valuing light-skinned people from the Global North more than dark-skinned people from the Global South. And there are practical implications as well. A recent study found that if the EPA assigned the same value to all lives, their newly proposed social cost of carbon would approximately double. That would mean the U.S. government will have to enhance the pace of action because now the cost of carbon would be much higher, the social cost will be much higher. And the higher the social cost of carbon, Chaturvedi points out, the more incentive there is for the U.S. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions quickly, which would save more lives around the world. Kelleher is more blunt about the implications of the EPA's choice. Is a grave, moral mistake. He says it's just not true that the lives of richer people are worth more. It's important to get it right because these are life and death decisions. Every molecule of carbon dioxide matters. Every ton of carbon dioxide matters. And so small changes in these dollar numbers - for example, the social cost of carbon - will make a big difference to who lives, who dies, how good their lives are, how bad their deaths are. The EPA is accepting public comments on its proposed social costs of carbon until February 13.Rebecca Hersher, NPR News. ",Climate
https://www.npr.org/2023/02/04/1149736969/gas-stove-makers-have-a-pollution-solution-theyre-just-not-using-it,2023-02-04,Gas stove makers have a pollution solution. They're just not using it,Jeff Brady,"Gas utilities and cooking stove manufacturers knew for decades that burners could be made that emit less pollution in homes, but they chose not to. That may may be about to change. Sean Gladwell/Getty Images hide caption, The heated debate over regulating gas stoves is really about the burners in those appliances. That's where natural gas, a fossil fuel, is combusted and air pollution is released into homes., Four decades ago, the gas industry and appliance manufacturers developed a partial solution for this problem. They created a cleaner and more efficient burner. But you can't buy ranges with those burners because the industry never manufactured those appliances for sale., Appliance manufacturers and gas industry allies say there are reasons for that: these burners cost more, are less durable, harder to clean, and they didn't see consumer demand for them., But now the industry appears ready to revisit the humble gas burner. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is investigating whether gas stoves need tighter regulations to protect human health. One commissioner even left open the possibility of banning sales of new gas stoves., This week, the Department of Energy (DOE) proposed rules that would require all stoves to be more energy efficient. If approved, more than half the gas cooktop market today wouldn't qualify under the new requirements, according to the DOE. The proposed regulations would take effect for sales of new stoves in 2027., Even if the federal government only tightens regulations on gas stoves, that would boost efforts from climate activists who want Americans to switch from gas to electric appliances and heaters. Studies from Princeton University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the National Academy of Sciences, find that zeroing out greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. by 2050 will require electrifying buildings, making appliances more efficient, and powering them mostly with emission-free sources like renewable energy., In the 1980s indoor air quality was in the news, and the CPSC was taking aim at another home appliance that burns fossil fuels: kerosene heaters. Sales were increasing, and regulators grew concerned, because the heaters emitted harmful pollution into homes, mainly nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide., The EPA says both pollutants can cause breathing problems, especially for people with asthma. And nitrogen dioxide, at higher levels and over longer periods, may contribute to developing asthma., The natural gas industry saw regulators' interest and worried the CPSC might come for gas cooking stoves next, according to a 1984 Science News article. That prompted two industry research groups to begin working on burner improvements., Out of that process emerged a ""jet-powered infrared gas-range burner."", Instead of the iconic blue flame that you normally see at a gas stove, the infrared burner had ""a flat ceramic plate... honeycombed with window-screen-like perforations,"" according to the article. Air and fuel burned as they were sent across the plate and ignited bright red in a way that makes the flame itself difficult to see., This infrared burner consumed about 40% less natural gas to reach cooking temperatures and emitted 40% less nitrogen oxides. The Science News article said designers touted another benefit of the infrared burner: a kitchen stays cooler because more energy goes into the cooking vessel instead of the room., A Pennsylvania-based stove manufacturer, Caloric Corporation, expressed interest in the infrared burner. That company is no longer in business and was absorbed into Whirlpool Corporation, which did not respond to multiple inquiries about why the burner was never offered in retail stoves., Another company involved in developing the infrared burner, Thermo Electron Corporation, is now called Thermo Fisher Scientific. A spokesperson says the company couldn't speak to the infrared burner development, and that the process might have been led by an independent researcher., The days of paying $6 for a burner on a $7,000 range may be over., Frank Johnson, research and development manager at GTI Energy, ""I'm sure the cost of that burner was probably significantly more than the existing technology,"" says Frank Johnson, research and development manager at GTI Energy in Des Plaines, Ill. The non-profit organization used to be called the Gas Technology Institute and is a research group closely tied to the gas industry., Johnson says he doesn't know exactly how much more the burners would cost, because the, ""technology has never been fully developed into a working range burner."", Kitchen range makers, such as Wolf, do offer infrared burners for charbroilers and griddles but not for stovetop or oven burners. Sub-Zero Group, which owns Wolf, did not respond to NPR's questions., Johnson delivered a warning to high-end manufacturers at an industry conference in Minneapolis last September, according to a recording of the event NPR had access to: ""The days of paying $6 for a burner on a $7,000 range may be over."", Both stove manufacturers and gas utilities face increasing scrutiny as scientific evidence accumulates that shows having a gas stove in the home may affect health, especially for children and people with breathing problems., Nitrogen dioxide is the big concern for health experts these days. Because of nitrogen dioxide emissions, the American Public Health Association labels gas cooking stoves ""a public health concern,"" and the American Medical Association warns that cooking with gas increases the risk of childhood asthma., A nitrogen dioxide air monitor in a Philadelphia kitchen on July 16, 2021 shows 0.159 parts per million, or 159 parts per billion. That's above the World Health Organization hourly guideline of 106 ppb. Jeff Brady/NPR hide caption, A nitrogen dioxide air monitor in a Philadelphia kitchen on July 16, 2021 shows 0.159 parts per million, or 159 parts per billion. That's above the World Health Organization hourly guideline of 106 ppb., A recent peer-reviewed paper found that more than 12.7% ""of current childhood asthma in the U.S. is attributable to gas stove use."" The gas utility industry pushed back on this latest study, which was funded by RMI, an environmental organization that encourages people to switch from gas to electric appliances., ""Organizations that are making these allegations are relying on reports that did not test natural gas stoves and have ignored research that found no association between gas stoves and asthma,"" wrote American Gas Association (AGA) President Karen Harbert in a statement to NPR., The AGA often tries to equate emissions from fossil fuel combustion to cooking fumes. Harbert pointed to research GTI Energy conducted last year, which compared electric and gas stoves and showed, ""no difference in their particulate emissions."", But particulate emissions from cooking are different from combustion emissions that come with burning natural gas. And when members of the industry talk amongst themselves, they are much clearer about that distinction., In a presentation two years ago, the AGA's Ted Williams cautioned colleagues not to discuss ventilation of combustion emissions, because not everyone with a gas stove has a hood that vents outdoors., ""[G]as cooking does generate indoor air emissions of contaminants, including carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, trace amounts of materials such as formaldehyde and so forth,"" said Williams in the 2020 webinar material provided to NPR. At the time, Williams was AGA's senior director for codes and standards., ""But recognizing that, it's not an issue that's going to be easy to paper over, because... these products do have emissions,"" said Williams., Gas stoves emit pollution into your house and they are connected to a production and supply system that leaks the powerful greenhouse gas methane during drilling, fracking, processing and transport. Meredith Miotke for NPR hide caption, Gas stoves emit pollution into your house and they are connected to a production and supply system that leaks the powerful greenhouse gas methane during drilling, fracking, processing and transport., For nitrogen dioxide, specifically, the EPA recommends reducing exposure by installing and using over a gas stove an exhaust fan that's vented outdoors. But that message isn't reaching consumers., ""There isn't much information available for people about the potential health risks of using a gas stove or the need for ventilation,"" says Matt Casale, director of environment campaigns at the United States Public Interest Research Group ., It's 40 years of potential cases of asthma and missed school days and missed workdays that potentially could have been avoided, Matt Casale, director of environment campaigns at the United States Public Interest Research Group, His organization surveyed 39 stores in 10 states to learn what customers are told about health effects of cooking with gas. Casale says a few sales staff did mention that they'd heard of indoor air quality issues with gas ranges and a push toward electric appliances. But that was only after they were specifically asked about the problem., Casale says the CPSC missed an opportunity to address this issue and regulate gas cooking stoves in the 1980s., ""It's 40 years of potential cases of asthma and missed school days and missed workdays that potentially could have been avoided,"" he says. But he's pleased to see the commission now ""doing its job"" by opening an information-gathering process that could lead to new regulations on gas stoves., When Consumer Product Safety Commission member Richard Trumka, Jr. talked with in December about ""Pollution-free cooking for the holidays,"" he spent time detailing the growing body of scientific evidence that shows emissions from gas cooking stoves can be harmful., It was only after that he said, ""That's why I think we need to be talking about regulating gas stoves, whether that's drastically improving emissions or banning gas stoves entirely."", Then a few weeks later, Trumka said the same thing to Bloomberg. That's when conservative politicians took up the issue, and it became part of the culture war., CPSC Chair Alexander Hoehn-Saric wrote on Twitter, ""I am not looking to ban gas stoves and the @USCPSC has no proceeding to do so."", Still, Hoehn-Saric wrote, ""CPSC is researching gas emissions in stoves and exploring new ways to address health risks."" But that did little to quell the uproar., Amid the kerfuffle, gas stove manufacturers and gas utilities appear to have a renewed interest in exploring cleaner burners for gas stoves., ""The design of cooking equipment has not changed a lot over time. But it's starting to change now, and it's just going to take time for those to become... available,"" GTI Energy's Johnson says., At upcoming trade shows, Johnson says many of his meetings and conversations will be focused on improving gas burner designs., ""There is a strong possibility to do things like improve the efficiency, improve the controls, improve the characteristics,"" Johnson says. ""And if you're going to do that, of course, you're also going to improve the emissions."", Individual manufacturers, including Whirlpool and Wolf, didn't respond to NPR's questions. The trade group Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers says it's likely appliance makers didn't adopt the infrared burners from 40 years ago because they're more expensive and the ceramic plates that glow red break., Also, since consumers weren't aware of air quality issues, reducing emissions from gas cooking is not something they asked for in a stove., Instead, AHAM says manufacturers focused on what consumers want: gas ranges that are easier to clean and more powerful. To address cooking and combustion emissions, the association has focused on standards for adequate ventilation above ranges. AHAM also says a new set of voluntary standards for nitrogen dioxide emissions from gas stoves is in the works., But that's not enough for critics like Amneh Minkara of the Sierra Club, who doesn't trust the industry to implement voluntary standards., ""It's been 40 years since they first realized that there was a safer alternative,"" Minkara says. ""I think if they're going to act, they're going to have to be forced to act. And I think it's the job of the regulators to make that happen."", The CPSC says it will start its ""request for information"" process on March 1st. While moving from that to developing actual regulations can be a long process, Commissioner Trumka told the in December that ""with enough public pressure, it doesn't have to be – we could get a regulation on the books before this time next year.""",Climate

A snowy winter recently has helped lake levels some. Kirk Siegler/NPR hide caption, The Great Salt Lake is roughly 8-9 feet lower than it should be. A snowy winter recently has helped lake levels some., Trekking along the shoreline of the Great Salt Lake — the largest remaining saltwater lake in the western hemisphere — can feel eerie and lonely., ""These might even be my footprints from last week,"" says Carly Biedul, pointing to indents in the mud. Biedul is a biologist with the Great Salt Lake Institute. She's bundled up in an orange puffy jacket, gloves and hat. Most important she's wearing thick, sturdy, rubber boots., The mud with a frozen, slick layer of ice on top gets treacherous. One thing that's hard to prepare for though, is the stench: a pungent odor like sulfur and dead fish. But it's actually a good thing, a sign of a biologically healthy saline lake., ""People have been saying that they miss the lake stink because it just makes them feel like home,"" Biedul says. ""It's just not here [much] anymore, so you're lucky that it gets to smell so bad."", Lucky? Maybe one small bright spot in an otherwise grim story of a looming ecological disaster. The lake doesn't really stink anymore because it's drying ... and dying., Scientists point to climate change and rapid population growth — Utah is one of the fastest growing states and also one of the driest — as the culprits. A recent scientific report from Brigham Young University warned that if no action is taken, the Great Salt Lake could go completely dry in five years., Over two decades of the western megadrought, water diversions from rivers that feed the lake have increased in order to support farms and thirsty, growing cities., Utah leaders and activists are springing into action., Carly Biedul and her team of researchers and students from Westminster College are on the front lines of the crisis and the fight to save the state's signature lake., Once a week they hike out to try to collect brine fly larva samples, with the idea that they could keep some alive in their lab back in the city should more water re-enter the lake in the near future., The larvae are harder and harder to find. On a recent cloudy, bitter cold morning, Biedul pointed out mounds or ""lumps"" of lake deposits called microbialites. They should be mostly submerged, but this day were protruding out along the receding shore. She dug out a refractometer to measure the water's salinity. Researchers have been worried the current levels — upwards of 17% in places — are too salty to sustain life., ""We're kind of at the threshold,"" Biedul says. ""If things get any saltier we're super worried."", Carly Biedul of the Great Salt Lake Institute is collecting lab samples on a recent chilly morning on the lake's receding south shoreline. Kirk Siegler/NPR hide caption, Carly Biedul of the Great Salt Lake Institute is collecting lab samples on a recent chilly morning on the lake's receding south shoreline., Consider the disappearing brine flies as an indicator species. They're at the bottom of the food chain, and feed the brine shrimp, which sustain the thousands of migrating birds and so on. The environmental consequences of a dried up lake are far reaching, and the economic fallout scenarios are dizzying — from the lake's brine shrimp fishing industry to mineral harvesting, to Utah's famous ski resorts that benefit from extra lake effect snow., But the most pressing concern right now in the Salt Lake Valley as the lake dries is shaping up to be air pollution. Salt Lake City already has some of the dirtiest air in the country. In the winter its natural topography causes cold air inversions, and emissions from vehicles and industrial sources form a haze in its bowl-like valley., The big unknown is how bad dust storms could get from a dried up lake bed. There is precedent. Along California's Eastern Sierra Nevada mountains, years of water diversions from the Owens River by the city of Los Angeles caused downstream saline Owens Lake to dry up. Dust storms from that lake bed became the largest single source of dust pollution in the nation., In Utah, the Great Salt Lake is more than seven times larger than the historic footprint of Owens Lake., ""This other piece of the dust coming in really scares people,"" Biedul says., Scientists warn the Great Salt Lake has high concentrations of neurotoxins and cancer causing carcinogens — including arsenic and mercury., ""If the lake bed dries up, and we're having winds blowing dust storms into our neighborhood, the heavy metals are going to land right on top of this neighborhood,"" says Turner Bitton, a community activist in Glendale, a traditionally working class neighborhood in Salt Lake City's west valley., Much of the area is zoned for manufacturing, but it's also one of the last bastions of affordability in the city. Bitton's neighborhood is already hemmed in by two busy freeways, an international airport, and it's close to Utah's largest oil refinery., He says many local families are alarmed at the prospect of the air getting even worse., ""We're talking about something that could potentially make these neighborhoods, I don't want to say uninhabitable, but for those that are vulnerable, for those that have lung issues, uninhabitable,"" Bitton says., Researchers have found higher rates of asthma and cardiovascular disease in neighborhoods like these. One University of Utah study even showed that students in schools here scored lower on tests during bad air days., ""We need to put more water in the lake now, we cannot let this wait,"" says Dr. Brian Moench, president of the group, Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment., Moench says the state should have declared an emergency years ago., ""A lot of people think that dust is pretty benign because it's quote — natural,"" he adds. ""Well that's not the case, and in the case of dust from the Great Salt Lake, it is particularly toxic, because we know that it is laced with high concentrations of heavy metals."", The majority of Utah's 3.3 million population lives near the lake, just to the east along the Wasatch Mountains. The lake is about nine feet lower than normal. And locals are already complaining of dust storms. Moench counted more than a dozen in the past year — when a decade ago there were none., On Utah's Capitol Hill, state lawmakers are debating a roughly $500 million spending package geared toward saving the lake. Kirk Siegler/NPR hide caption, On Utah's Capitol Hill, state lawmakers are debating a roughly $500 million spending package geared toward saving the lake., At the state capitol, lawmakers this session are facing pressure to save the lake, and Gov. Spencer Cox is under the gun to call a state of emergency. In his state of the state address last month, Cox nodded to the BYU study which warns that in just ""five short years,"" the Great Salt Lake will completely disappear: ""Let me be absolutely clear, we are not going to let that happen."" Cox said., Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of state lawmakers unveiled bills ranging from expanding turf-reduction programs in cities, to providing more incentives to farmers to divert less water from rivers that feed the lake. Some pledged to spend upwards of a half billion dollars to save the lake., ""Even though the Great Salt Lake has risen a foot so far, we know that one wet winter is not going to wipe out two decades of very, very, very dry climate here in Utah,"" said Brad Wilson, the Republican House Speaker., Some ideas that have been floated sound like something out of a science fiction novel — including cloud seeding, and even a plan to build pipelines to pump in water from the Pacific Ocean., ""We are getting some really fantastical suggestions from some of our lawmakers as to how to solve this,"" says Moench, of Physicians for a Healthy Environment., Moench and environmental activists are arguing for buying out alfalfa farmers so more water will return to the Great Salt Lake. But some are encouraged that at the very least saving the lake is one of the top priorities of this legislative session., From Utah's Capitol Hill, there's a sweeping view of the Salt Lake City skyline, and to the west, past the airport, the receding lake is visible, shimmering gray at dusk. It's an ominous sight, but if nothing else, hard for state leaders to ignore., Down at the lake, Carly Biedul of the Great Salt Lake Institute is doing her best to keep positive. She thinks there's still time to save this lake, but not much., ""It's really pretty right now, you can see the reflections of the mountains on the water,"" she says. ""And that's kind of what we're been trying to do is find these moments of beauty when it's so ... sad.""",National
https://www.npr.org/2023/02/03/1154091908/morning-news-brief,2023-02-03,Morning news brief,"Steve Inskeep, Leila Fadel","Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to make a short trip to China this weekend. China and the U.S. have been trying to cool off tensions. They've been talking a little bit. But their strategic competition continues, and the latest source of tension is high over the United States. The Pentagon asserts that a Chinese surveillance balloon has been flying high over Montana. Watching episodes of ""Yellowstone"" maybe? We just don't know. To talk about how this might affect Blinken's visit, we're joined by NPR China correspondent Emily Feng. Hi, Emily. Hey, Leila. OK. Emily, why don't we just start by talking about what a surveillance balloon even is, what it looks like? And what do we know about the one that was supposedly spotted over Montana? So in this case, this was a large white balloon - so big, in fact, that it was spotted by people on the ground in Montana. And it's used to collect intel from the air. A senior defense official in the U.S. said they are absolutely certain it was China that set it afloat, though they did not explain how they knew that, and that the U.S. has been tracking this balloon from the moment it entered U.S. airspace a few days ago. The spokesperson said there was a discussion about whether to shoot it down, but they decided to let it be because it's flying at such high altitude that the Pentagon said it poses no physical or military risk, though it was flying over U.S. missile sites. Now, countries spy on each other all the time from the air, using satellites and drones. And while a balloon does seem a little unusual, the defense official said it's actually happened a couple of times over the past few years.This is what a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson had to say about the balloon. (Non-English language spoken). So the spokesperson in China said, ""China is figuring out the relevant situation, and we hope to deal with this calmly with the U.S."" But, diplomatically, this is really awkward. It puts the two countries again at odds with one another, even before the secretary of state has gone to China, and has also given China hawks in the U.S. more material to seize on. The U.S. and China have been trying to stabilize their relationship diplomatically, but this incident and ongoing bipartisan efforts to increase sanctions on China could get in the way of that. So this is very public. Despite the spotting of this spy balloon, do you think that this visit could lead to any type of breakthrough with the rocky relationship? So, first of all, what's interesting is Blinken's trip to China has not been officially confirmed by either side. Neither country has commented publicly on the trip, though we do expect that the secretary of state should be leaving for China on Sunday. The trip looks like it's still on despite this kerfuffle over the balloon. But expectations are really low, and they're probably even lower now given this balloon drama. U.S. officials and former diplomats I've been speaking to say the trip might result in some kind of joint statement, perhaps on combating climate change or perhaps even something against the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. But there are no expected deliverables, and there shouldn't really be any breakthroughs on the main issues at the heart of the U.S.-China relationship. OK, then what's the point of the visit at all? That's a really good question. Well, officials emphasize talking is better than just not talking at all. And there are some meaty issues at the heart of the relationship over human rights, combating climate change, technological competition. So that involves getting China on board, even if the two countries don't see eye to eye. And the fact that Blinken's even going to China is already progress. NPR's Emily Feng. Thanks so much. Thanks, Leila. An inmate at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has been released to Belize. The former prisoner is 42 years old. He's a native of Pakistan. And his name is Majid Khan. He sued the Biden administration for unlawful imprisonment last year. NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer has been covering Khan's release. Sacha, good morning. Good morning. So tell us about Majid Khan. Who is he? He was an unusual Guantanamo prisoner in several ways. He's a Pakistani citizen, but he grew up in Maryland, near Baltimore. And more than a decade ago, he pleaded guilty in Guantanamo's military court to being an al-Qaida courier. And there was some drama during his sentencing because a military jury urged that he get leniency. This was after jurors heard how he had been tortured at a secret CIA prison after being captured. Now, Khan completed his sentence almost a year ago, and he was free to leave Guantanamo, but the United States kept holding him. OK, so Khan pleads guilty after being tortured, completes his sentence. Why was he still being held? Well, there were no legal grounds. It's just that the U.S. could not find another country to take him. He could not be safely transferred to Pakistan because he had cooperated with U.S. authorities. And then last summer, U.S. officials said they'd been in touch with 11 countries but apparently could not find any takers. And, Leila, this is a big issue at Guantanamo. Yeah. It's a common problem because the majority of Gitmo prisoners have been approved for release but are still being held. Some of them have been in that limbo state for more than a decade. Wow. And that's even though they've never been charged with a crime. But these transfer deals are delicate. They're complicated negotiations. So a lot of the men are cleared to go, but they remain behind bars. So Belize agrees to take Khan. Does he have any connection to Belize? No, he doesn't. And the U.S. has not explained why Belize agreed to take him. We're talking, of course, about the small English-speaking country in Central America. It has a population of only about 400,000 people. But countries that accept former Guantanamo prisoners have to agree to treat them humanely and provide security assurances, and Belize has emphasized that Khan is there as a free man on humanitarian grounds, just as if he were a migrant or a refugee looking for a second chance. I spoke with one of Khan's lawyers, and she's elated he's been released, but she did have harsh words for the U.S. government's operation at Guantanamo. Her name is Katya Jestin, and here's part of what she told me. In what system do you finish your sentence, when you were sentenced by a court of law, and remain in jail? Where does that happen? Certainly not in a democracy that is governed by a system of laws. What is the U.S. government saying about Khan's release? Let me read to you from the Defense Department's announcement about his transfer. It says in part, quote, ""the United States appreciates the willingness of the government of Belize and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and, ultimately, closing the Guantanamo Bay facility."" That's the end of the quote. So how many prisoners are still at Guantanamo, and how many are now and still in Khan's position, where they were cleared for release? So 34 men remain. Twenty of them fall in the category we talked about of never having been charged with anything and been approved for release, yet sitting in prison while the U.S. tries to find countries to take them. Now, their cases are arguably more egregious than Khan's because at least he was charged with a crime and went through a court process. These others are considered forever prisoners, meaning held indefinitely without charge or trial. Forever prisoners. NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer. Thank you. You're welcome. Climate change and rapid population growth are drying up the Great Salt Lake in Utah. As the name implies, this lake is huge but getting smaller. And scientists at Utah universities warn it will disappear in five years if no action is taken. Here's Utah Governor Spencer Cox talking about that study in his recent State of the State address. Let me be absolutely clear - we are not going to let that happen. So what are the consequences of the Great Salt Lake completely drying up? To understand that, let's bring in NPR correspondent Kirk Siegler for more. Hi, Kirk. Hi, Leila. OK. So how close are we from an environmental breaking point here, and what can be done so we don't get there? Well, we are very close, so I'm told, if we're not there already. For some context, the Great Salt Lake is anywhere from about eight to nine feet below what it should be. Utah's having a snowy winter right now. That's helped a little bit. But we would need several of these in a row. You know, this crisis is the result of the 20-plus-year megadrought here in the West and also water diversions from rivers upstream from the lake for farming, mostly going to animal feed crops, as well as cities. You know, Utah is one of the fastest-growing states in the West. And scientists say we're at this breaking point.I went out on the lake with one of them on a recent cold, gray morning. Carly Biedul of the Great Salt Lake Institute - we're walking across the dried-up shore of the lake bed. It's this otherworldly experience. And she's trying to find brine fly larva, Leila, to take back to her lab. Now, it's getting harder and harder to find this. They're at the bottom of the food chain. As the lake dries up, it's getting too salty to sustain life. And, you know, if they go away, then the brine shrimp go away, and then the thousands of migrating birds that rely on the brine shrimp may go away. So it's disastrous. The threshold is - we're kind of at the threshold. So if things get any saltier, we're super, super worried. OK. Well, this doesn't sound good. No. Kirk, Salt Lake City sits in the valley where, in the wintertime, cold air and pollution from cars and industry gets trapped. It already has some of the dirtiest air in the nation. So if the Great Salt Lake dries up, does that also then make this worse? Yeah, this is probably the biggest, most pressing concern with the lake drying up. The dust from the dried lakebed would be toxic. You've got high concentrations of mercury and arsenic out there, so if dust storms were to blow, they'd probably go east, right to Salt Lake City, particularly immediately into neighborhoods that are close to the lake, that are also close to Salt Lake City International Airport, a lot of busy freeways and an oil refinery. So neighborhood activists, as you can imagine, are very concerned about this. And, Leila, you were, along with me, based in California... Yeah. ...Pretty recently, right? Do you remember Owens Lake? Mmm hmm. Well, the city of Los Angeles diverted water for years from the Owens River, and that dried up the saline lake, the Owens Lake. And now it's the largest single-source pollutant in the U.S. And the Great Salt Lake is seven times bigger than Owens Lake. So there's a looming disaster out there and a lot of pressure on Utah lawmakers to come up with solutions in the coming months. Oh, my gosh. Toxic dust, the possibility that life can't be sustained - what's being done? Well, they want to spend approximately half-a-billion dollars to do things like create a central state agency to manage the lake. They want to pay farmers to leave water in those creeks and rivers so those rivers - more water would flow into the lake. They also want to expand a lawn removal program in cities. And scientists I've talked to are encouraged by this but say they may not go far enough. So big changes have to be made. NPR's Kirk Siegler. Thanks so much. Glad to be here. ",National Security

Why aren't they available?",Jeff Brady,"There's been a lot of chatter lately about gas stoves; namely that when you turn on your gas stove, it emits pollution that can affect the health of people in your home. Yeah, OK, I got it. But manufacturers know how to make burners cleaner and much more efficient. In fact, they've known how for a long time. Problem is, stoves with those burners have never been offered for sale. But that may be about to change. Jeff Brady from NPR's Climate Desk joins us now. Hey, Jeff. Hey, Ailsa. OK, so let me get this straight. Manufacturers have known how to do this for a long time - (laughter) what? So for how long, and why did they originally invest in developing cleaner burners? It had started about 40 years ago. Federal regulators were considering a ban on kerosene space heaters because they put out a lot of air pollution into a room. And gas cooking stove makers and gas utility saw that and worried the government might come for them next. So they developed this thing called an infrared burner. It uses 40% less gas, emits 40% less nitrogen dioxide, and NO2 is the pollutant that public health experts worry about most when it comes to cooking with gas. Research shows that there is a connection between having a gas stove and childhood asthma, as well as other health problems. And if you reduce the pollutants from the burners, that likely would also reduce the risk of illness. OK. So tell me more. How are these efficient or more efficient burners different exactly? Well, instead of that familiar blue flame, these infrared gas burners look more like a traditional electric burner. They glow red, and you can hardly even see that there's a flame there. I showed this design to Brady Seals at the environmental group RMI, and she said the fact that manufacturers and utilities developed a partial solution for the pollution issue and didn't sell the burners just underscores the need for regulation. You know, the time is long overdue for mandatory performance standards for gas stoves so that we can make sure that they are meeting a health protective levels of pollutants inside our homes. Appliance manufacturers say they're working on voluntary standards to limit nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves. Wait. So why don't manufacturers make and sell these cleaner burners and gas stoves already? Like, what's the problem? One reason is, is that iconic blue flame. It goes away on infrared burners. And that's a big part of their marketing. It is? Yes. A lot of utilities feature that blue flame in their logo. And also these burners, they're more expensive, and they can be a little harder to clean. But most importantly, consumers just haven't demanded a cleaner burner. But that may be changing now that gas stoves are in the news again. I talked with Frank Johnson. He's at GTI Energy. That's a gas industry research organization. And he says they're working on new burner improvements now. The design of cooking equipment has not changed a lot over time, but it's starting to change now, and it's just going to take time for those to become available. And for gas utilities, that stove is key. It doesn't consume a lot of gas, but it's considered kind of this gateway appliance. People like cooking on them. And if there's already a gas stove in a house, it's more likely that consumers will burn gas in their furnace, their water heater or clothes dryer. Exactly. OK. Well, the reason we're talking more about this now is because of all the regulation issues that have been discussed. Earlier this month, in fact, somebody on the Consumer Product Safety Commission was talking about banning gas stoves. Is that a real possibility, you think? You know, it seems unlikely to me, but the commission is starting on March 1 to look at the available science about health and safety risks. Commissioner Richard Trumka, he's the one you mentioned about banning gas stoves. He said that in December. And I'll just summarize what he said, that these processes usually can take a long time, but this one could happen by this time next year. That is NPR's Jeff Brady. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you.

Climate Summit, Nov. 16, 2022, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Peter Dejong/AP hide caption, Demonstrators pretend to resuscitate the Earth while advocating for the 1.5 degree warming goal to survive at the COP27 U.N. Climate Summit, Nov. 16, 2022, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt., The world will likely breach the internationally agreed-upon climate change threshold in about a decade, and keep heating to break through a next warming limit around mid-century even with big pollution cuts, artificial intelligence predicts in a new study that's more pessimistic than previous modeling., The study in Monday's journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reignites a debate on whether it's still possible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as called for in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, to minimize the most damaging effects of climate change. The world has already warmed 1.1 or 1.2 degrees since pre-industrial times, or the mid-19th century, scientists say., Two climate scientists using machine learning calculated that Earth will surpass the 1.5 degree (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) mark between 2033 and 2035. Their results fit with other, more conventional methods of predicting when Earth will break the mark, though with a bit more precision., ""There will come a time when we call the 1.5C target for maximum warming dead, beyond the shadow of a doubt,"" Brown University environment institute director Kim Cobb, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email interview. ""And this paper may be the beginning of the end of the 1.5C target."", Stanford University's Noah Diffenbaugh, a study co-author, said the world is on the brink of the 1.5-degree mark in ""any realistic emissions reduction scenario."" Avoiding a 2-degree rise, he said, may depend on nations meeting zero-emissions goals by the middle of this century., The artificial intelligence-based study found it unlikely that temperature increase could be held below 2 degrees Celsius, even with tough emissions cuts. And that's where the AI really differs with scientists who had been forecasting using computer models that are based on past observations, Diffenbaugh said., In a high-pollution scenario, the AI calculated, the world would hit the 2-degree mark around 2050. Lower pollution could stave that off until 2054, the machine learning calculated., In contrast, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change figured in its 2021 report that the same lower-pollution scenario would see the world pushing past 2 degrees sometime in the 2090s., Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the Diffenbaugh study but was part of the IPCC, said the study makes sense, fits with what scientists know, but seems a bit more pessimistic., There's a lot of power in using AI and in the future that may be shown to produce better projections, but more evidence is needed before concluding that, Mahowald said., Normally, climate scientists use a bunch of computer model simulations, some running hot and some cold, and then try to figure out which ones are doing the best job. That's often based on how they performed in the past or in simulations of the past, Diffenbaugh said. What the AI does is more keyed to the climate system now, he said., ""We're using this very powerful tool that is able to take information and integrate it in a way that no human mind is able to do, for better or for worse,"" Diffenbaugh said., Each year, government climate negotiators at a United Nations summit proclaim that they have managed to ""keep 1.5 alive."" But with the latest study there's a divide among scientists on how true that really is. Diffenbaugh said there's been so much warming already that it really doesn't matter how pollution is cut in the next several years, the world will hit 1.5, the AI figures., Zeke Hausfather of the tech company Stripe and Berkeley Earth, who was not part of the study, agreed, saying it's time to ""stop pretending"" that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees is possible. Some scenarios do see temperatures warming past the mark but then coming back down, something called ""overshoot."", Other scientists not involved with the study, such as University of Pennsylvania's Michael Mann and Climate Analytics' Bill Hare and Carl-Friedrich Schleussner maintain 1.5 is still alive. They say one rapid decarbonization scenario that Diffenbaugh didn't examine shows the world can mostly keep under the threshold., If the world can cut its carbon emissions in half by 2030 ""then warming can be limited to 1.5 degrees"" with a tiny overshoot and then reductions to get under the mark, Hare said., Believing that the world can no longer keep warming below 1.5 ""is a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Mann said by email. ""In the end it's easy to overinterpret the significance of a precise threshold like 1.5C warming. The challenge is to limit warming as much as possible.""",Climate

Can the power grid handle it?,"Brianna Scott, William Troop, Ailsa Chang",": [EDITOR' The statement in this story that “to power all those vehicles the state will need to triple the amount of electricity that’s currently produced” needs clarification. It mischaracterized what the California Energy Commission said in a 2021 report. That report stated that California will need to “roughly triple” it’s “electricity power capacity” in order to meet a key climate goal – 100 percent clean electricity by 2045. Capacity in this case is not the same as the amount of overall electricity produced. It’s just the ability to make electricity – as in, how much you could make all at once if you needed to.] California has some of the most ambitious climate goals in the country. And the state is pushing hard to eliminate as many gas-powered vehicles from its roads as quickly as possible. One key goal - that all new cars and light trucks sold in the state be electric by 2035. That's the mandate set out by the California Air Resources Board last year, and it could mean 12 million more EVs on California's roads. Nadia Lopez is an environment reporter with CalMatters, a partner in our California hub newsroom. She's reported recently on the challenges that the state is facing as it tries to reach its climate goals and joins us now. Welcome. Hi. It's great to be here. Great to have you. OK. So first, tell us about the rule I just mentioned, this mandate that all new cars and light trucks sold in the state by 2035 be electric. What is California actively doing to make that happen? As part of the 2035 electric car mandate, car companies basically need to gradually electrify their fleet of new vehicles. So beginning with 2026 models, that means 35% of all new vehicles sold have to be electric. That increases to 68% by 2030, until finally reaching 100% in 2035. So to prepare, the state is investing in a lot of clean energy projects, more public charging stations and transmission line upgrades and that buildout. To put it in perspective, California will need 1.2 million chargers to support this transition. Wow. We have about 80,000. Oh. OK. There's a long way to go. Well, even if we do end up building all those new charging stations, I mean, you basically raised the one, big question still is, where will the electricity come from for all of those charging stations, all of those millions of new electric vehicles? Because I have to say, as a California resident, I'm honestly wondering that, too. I remember, like, during last summer's heat waves, we were all asked to use really limited amounts of electricity during peak hours to avoid blackouts. So can the state's power grid actually supply what will be needed? So to power all these vehicles, the state will need to triple the amount of electricity that's currently produced. That means deploying new clean energy projects. That means upgrading and building new transmission lines to deliver power. But also it means encouraging residents to charge their cars during times of the day when energy demand is the lowest to avoid the potential strain on the grid. OK. So we're talking about triple the amount of electricity supply, right? Can you just, like, talk more about that? Like, what kind of clean energy projects will be needed to support this whole transition to millions more electric vehicles? So clean energy projects include large-scale solar projects, new wind farms and also developing a brand-new industry that currently doesn't exist. It's promising and could supply tons of energy within the next 12 to 20 years, but offshore wind development is super ambitious, and so far, no projects exist. So what happens if California can't meet its goals in the various years it wants to meet their goals? A lot is at stake when it comes to California meeting its clean energy goals. Cleaning up its air pollution could also be a big problem. It could continue to burden many low-income and disadvantaged communities. Apart from that, you know, ramping up clean energy, we're facing the closure of our natural gas plants and our last nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon, which is supposed to shut down in 2030. If we can't source enough of our energy from renewables by that point, then there's also the risk that the state will have to consider extending operations at those facilities.

A recent interview with the commissioner of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) quickly became fodder for outrage, viral misinformation and political fundraising, after he proposed regulating the appliance. The proposal stems from a growing body of research suggesting gas stoves are unhealthy — especially for those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and children., Gas stoves also leak methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the environment. Scientists at Stanford University measured methane emissions from 53 California homes and found that most leaks happened when the stove was off. The 2022 study found that leaks were caused by loose couplings and fittings of the gas lines and pipes., ""Simply owning a natural gas stove and having natural gas pipes and fittings in your home leads to more emissions over 24 hours than the amount emitted while the burners are on,"" says Rob Jackson, one of the study authors., NPR climate and energy correspondent Jeff Brady talked to experts and conducted his own test to separate fact from fiction.

This local resident in Barconie (ph), a town on the west coast of Liberia, sprinkles gin, a boiled egg and rice into the murky blue water of a lagoon. No one is allowed to kill any of the animals that live here, in a small expanse of water nestling between the mangroves and the Atlantic Ocean. All of the fishes you see in the water there? You have all the people in a community. It is a sacred space to residents, explains Alphonso Dennis, the town's chairperson. If you kill one of the fish, somebody in the community will be affected. In West Africa, many communities have set aside sacred spaces like these to be protected at all costs. It is a relationship with nature that has been handed down generation to generation.

Carlos Giusti/AP hide caption, In this Sept. 20, 2017 file photo, electricity poles and lines lie toppled on the road after Hurricane Maria hit the eastern region of the island in Humacao, Puerto Rico., It's becoming clearer how Puerto Rico might meet its goal of getting 100% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2050., Half-way through a two-year federal government study, called PR100, researchers concluded the island has significantly more renewable energy potential than it needs. The report was released Monday. Researchers found there's a preference among many residents for ""distributed energy,"" which is generated near where it's used. Rooftop solar panels are the most common example of that., ""We were able to prove that these systems are resilient to hurricane winds, and they can provide pretty fast power, within hours after a storm,"" says Agustín Carbó, Director of the Department of Energy's Puerto Rico Grid Modernization and Recovery Team. He says the current system of fewer, centralized and larger power plants takes longer to restore electricity across the island, especially in remote and mountainous regions., Last year the DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, with funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, began studying options to transition the island to 100% renewable energy by 2050. The goal is to build an electricity system that is more resilient against future storms, which climate change research shows will be bigger and more powerful., The plan is to transition away from imported fossil fuels — petroleum, natural gas and coal — to cleaner sources such as solar and wind. Another goal is to make electricity more affordable. The island's power rates are about twice as high as average rates across the U.S. The federal study is expected to be completed by the end of this year., Four different scenarios have been modeled to meet Puerto Rico's targets — all include more rooftop solar combined with battery storage. First is a focus on installing distributed energy on buildings where owners could then get the financial benefits of generating electricity. The second focuses on critical services, such as hospitals, fire stations and grocery stores. The third includes prioritizing deployment in remote and low-to-moderate income households to distribute benefits equitably. The final option is to install solar panels on as many other rooftops as possible., Even before all those solar panels can be installed, study authors say the island needs more utility-scale electricity generation., ""Significant additional generation capacity is obviously needed immediately to improve reliability, which is an issue that all of us in Puerto Rico have been struggling (with) after Hurricane Maria and Fiona,"" says Carbó, who formerly chaired the Puerto Rico Energy Commission. He says fossil fuels will still be needed in the short-term while the island works to meet its 100% renewable goal., The Department of Energy and FEMA are gathering input for the study with an advisory panel of nearly 100 people and 50 public, private and nonprofit organizations., ""For far too long, Puerto Ricans have lived with an outdated and expensive electric system where needless obstacles and long delays have prevented critical improvements,"" said Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm in a written statement accompanying a progress report on the study., Puerto Rico's grid collapsed in 2017 after Hurricane Maria hit the island, killing at least 3,000 residents. Months afterward crews struggled to restore generating capacity and rebuild the transmission lines. After years of discontent over mismanagement and corruption at the U.S. territory's public power company, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, was privatized., Last September, Hurricane Fiona brought over 30 inches of rain to some areas and again knocked out power on the island. There's widespread dissatisfaction with the private company, LUMA, which the government awarded a $1.5 billion contract to operate the grid.",Climate
https://www.npr.org/2023/01/23/1150716085/why-higher-winter-temperatures-are-affecting-the-logging-industry,2023-01-23,Why higher winter temperatures are affecting the logging industry,Henry Epp,"A warm winter in the Northeast is making it harder for loggers to do their jobs. Here's Henry Epp from our member station Vermont Public Radio. Brian Lafoe is operating a machine called a forwarder in a patch of woods in East Burke, a small town in northeastern Vermont. He maneuvers a mechanized arm to pick up logs that his son-in-law felled, split and piled along a road they cut through the forest. The heavy machinery has left ruts in the ground. Usually that's not an issue at this time of year. In the wintertime, you got this wet ground. The ground gets froze up. Our machines go over it good. We don't do no damage. But on this sunny January morning, the temperature is starting to rise above freezing. And that means Lafoe can't run the forwarder much longer or else he'll start to damage the soil. Winter is a crucial season for loggers like Lafoe. Typically, the frozen ground allows them to access sensitive wooded areas like this nearly every day. But this year, temperatures surged into the 50s in early January, and there's mud and ice where there should be deep snow. You shouldn't be able to see this ground. We should have snow right now. Life should be good. It should be zero degrees. We should be going. Instead, this job has taken Lafoe about two weeks longer than normal, and he'll have to do more work in the summer to repair the rutted logging trails. All told, he guesses the weather will increase his costs by about 17%. Luckily, he paid off all his equipment, like the forwarder, years ago. I guess a good way to put it - if I didn't own all this stuff, I probably wouldn't be doing it right now. I'd be retired. But I think this is shades of things to come. This is David Senio, the forester working with Brian Lafoe on this project. With climate change, winters are becoming shorter and more unpredictable in Vermont. Cutting down trees which store carbon could be adding to that climate impact. But Senio argues there's also a climate-positive effect of logging. Responsibly managing forests can make them healthier in the long run. But warming winters limit how often loggers can do that work. How do you make more productive days in a year? You don't. And, Senio says, all of Vermont's $1.4 billion forest products industry is impacted by the changing climate - not just loggers, but sawmill operators, too. Goodridge Lumber in Albany, Vt., relies on loggers like Brian Lafoe for the wood that's running through their sawmill. Workers feed white cedar logs along a spinning saw blade, cutting them into posts and boards. But because loggers haven't been able to harvest as much this year, owner Colleen Goodridge says her sawmill's store of fresh logs is running low. This year, we don't have that extra inventory that we had last year. So we are hoping that, you know, we have a strong next few weeks. Sales are good right now, Goodridge says, but it's not clear how long that will last. She's thinking of ways to diversify her business, like finding markets for lower-quality wood. Still, she's trying to be optimistic about the rest of the season. I'm hopeful. And, you know, we've had cold weather in April. We've had Aprils that hung on and hung on and hung on. So we just don't know. Goodridge has been in the lumber business for 49 years. Her sons are now co-owners. But she's worried about the future of this industry in Vermont. High costs and the unpredictability of a changing climate make it a tough business for young people to enter. They say to live is to experience change. Well, you know, I guess we're living. Goodridge just hopes the logging industry can adapt to all this change.For NPR News, I'm Henry Epp in northern Vermont. ",National

This winter has already delivered snow totals above 130% of average, but climate scientists say it will take more than one wet winter to pull the arid West out of a 23-year drought., This winter, the West has been slammed by wet weather. Heavy rains have pummeled California, and the Rocky Mountains are getting buried with snow., That's good news for the Colorado River, where that moisture hints at a possible springtime boost for massive reservoirs that have been crippled by drought. Climate scientists, though, say the 40 million people who use the river's water should take the good news with a grain of salt., Snow piled high in the Rockies is crucial for the Colorado River — a water lifeline for people from Wyoming to Mexico in an area commonly referred to as the Colorado River Basin. Before water flows through rivers, pipelines and canals to cities and farms across the region, it starts as high-altitude snow. In fact, more than two-thirds of the river begins as snow in Colorado. This year, snowfall totals are well above average, but climate scientists say the winter is far from over and conditions could change bringing less precipitation., ""Everybody is so eager to make an early call on this,"" said Brad Udall, a water and climate researcher at Colorado State University. ""Invariably, you'll get caught with your pants down if you think you know what's going to happen."", The Colorado River is in crisis, shrinking at the hands of climate change. A 23-year ""megadrought"" has created the region's driest conditions in 1,800 years. That has created a yawning supply-demand imbalance for a multibillion-dollar agriculture sector and large cities — such as Denver, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Los Angeles — that depend on the river's water., More eyes are now turning to the snow-laden mountains that keep the river flowing and help to fill the nation's two largest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell. Those reservoirs have dropped to historic lows — jeopardizing hydropower for millions of people and threatening the need for costly modifications to the towering dams that hold the water back., Eric Balken, with the Glen Canyon Institute, walks past a sunken speedboat in a side canyon in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. Water levels in Lake Powell have steadily dropped, revealing areas that have been underwater for decades. Alex Hager/KUNC hide caption, Eric Balken, with the Glen Canyon Institute, walks past a sunken speedboat in a side canyon in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. Water levels in Lake Powell have steadily dropped, revealing areas that have been underwater for decades., Meanwhile, mountain snow totals are off to a promising start. Around Snowmass in Colorado the snowpack is 130% of average for this time of the year. The Roaring Fork watershed, which includes Aspen and Snowmass, makes up only 0.5% of the landmass in the Colorado River Basin but provides about 10% of its water., In other nearby mountain ranges, snow totals are between 140% and 160% above average. Even if those numbers persist until spring, the severity of the Colorado River's drought means many more years of heavy snow are needed to make a serious dent in the low water levels., ""It's great to see a big snowpack,"" Udall said. ""We would need five or six years at 150% snowpack to refill these reservoirs. And that is extremely unlikely."", A string of wet years is unlikely because of rising temperatures driven by climate change, Udall said. Since 1970, temperatures in the Colorado River Basin have gone up by three degrees Fahrenheit. Those higher temperatures have already caused a 15% drop in streamflows across the region., Warming has driven a raft of worrying environmental changes across the region. In recent years, scientists have sounded the alarm about soils drying out. The ground has become parched and soaks up snowmelt before the water has a chance to reach the places where people divert and collect it., Already, Udall said, winters with 90% of average snowpack have led to only 50% spring runoff because thirsty soil acts like a sponge., Even the concept of ""average"" has changed due to warming temperatures. In spring 2021, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shifted how it calculates averages for all of its data., Every 10 years, NOAA moves the three-decade window that it uses for averages. But the rapidly accelerating effects of climate change mean the current window from 1991 to 2020 sticks out from previous 30-year periods because it includes the hottest-ever period in America's recorded history., Because of that, snowpack data tells a somewhat deceptive story. For example, if snowpack is at 130%, the number would appear substantially lower if current totals were compared to normal snowpack going back further than 30 years., ""Man, we need to continue to plan for the worst here,"" Udall said. That's what we've seen the last 23 years. That's what these warming temperatures continue to tell us."", Planning has become much harder as shifting baselines make the future of water availability less predictable., A supply-demand imbalance has shrunk Lake Powell, the nation's second largest reservoir, imperiling reserves for a multibillion dollar agriculture sector and large cities – such as Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles – that depend on water from the Colorado River. Alex Hager/KUNC hide caption, A supply-demand imbalance has shrunk Lake Powell, the nation's second largest reservoir, imperiling reserves for a multibillion dollar agriculture sector and large cities – such as Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles – that depend on water from the Colorado River., Cynthia Campbell, who has advised the city of Phoenix on water law for over a decade, knows this firsthand. The nation's fifth-largest city gets more than one-third of its water from the Colorado River., ""Our worst case scenario, from our perspective, is that we have to be in the habit of annually looking to the mountains to see what is the precipitation,"" Campbell said., She said reservoirs should function as a buffer against the fluctuation of dry years and wet years. But with reserves shrinking to never-before-seen lows, cities around the arid West can only plan one year at a time., ""That's just not enough time to make changes that you would have to make,"" Campbell said with a nervous chuckle. ""But that is where we are. So, in some ways, it might be our worst nightmare."", Campbell and Phoenix residents are not alone in their hand-wringing., As supply shrinks, the seven states that use water from the Colorado River have been caught in a standoff over how to reduce demand., Water allocation across the basin is governed by a 1922 legal agreement that hasn't been substantially rewritten to meet the needs of a changing region. Some experts suggest that agreement — the Colorado River Compact — should be replaced to meet the modern demands of a region with sprawling fields of crops and booming urban populations., As the drought has worsened, states have agreed on a patchwork of tweaks to prop up reservoirs and stave off catastrophe, but they have been unable to reach a deal for larger, more permanent cutbacks of water use., At meetings about the river's future, delegates from the seven states — including Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and California — are quick to talk about the need for a collaborative solution to their collective problem but are reluctant to commit to sacrificing portions of their own shares., The current managing guidelines for the river expire in 2026, and states are mostly focused on drawing up a new agreement before then. Policy analysts and water managers have hinted that major cuts will have to come from the agricultural sector, which uses more than 70% of the Colorado River's water., In the meantime, cities have had to get creative to stretch finite quantities of water for their growing populations. Those efforts have not been changed by this winter's strong mountain snow or the rain that drenched California for days, causing major flooding and widespread damage., ""One storm is not going to change the game whether we get a wet year or not,"" said Adel Hagekhalil, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. ""We need to continue to focus on building the infrastructure we need to create local water supply."", The district supplies drinking water to 19 million people from north of Los Angeles to the Mexican border. The agency has undertaken a number of ambitious projects to reuse water that is already in the system., One proposed facility in Carson, California, would clean up sewage to make it drinkable. The treatment setup is projected to cost $3.4 billion to build. Once completed, it would cost $129 million to operate each year. That new facility aims to redirect up to 150 million gallons back into the municipal water supply in and around Los Angeles., Water agencies in Nevada and Arizona plan to pitch in, helping pay for the project in exchange for some of Southern California's water. The hefty price tag is just one example of the many new infrastructure costs cities may incur due to climate change., ""We have to be ready,"" Hagekhalil said, ""And it will be on us if we're gonna take the right actions today to invest and build the necessary infrastructure."", Elsewhere around the Colorado River Basin, governments have teased the idea of investing in other ways to augment existing water supplies. Last year, Arizona's then-governor Doug Ducey proposed a deal with Mexico in which the state would fund an ocean desalination plant on the Gulf of California. That would allow Mexico to use the newly-desalted water in exchange for some of Mexico's share from the Colorado River., Inventive solutions like wastewater reuse and desalination have generated buzz among denizens of the region's parched cities. But water policy analysts say none of them can serve as a silver bullet for those who depend on the shrinking Colorado River. Instead, they say, significant cutbacks to demand are the only way to meet the challenges posed by climate change's impact on water supplies., This story is part of ongoing coverage of the Colorado River, produced by KUNC in Colorado and supported by the Walton Family Foundation.

Selma gave so much. This history is so rich that it's sort of like Mecca coming to America. JoAnne Bland is a veteran of the civil rights movement and Bloody Sunday in Selma, Ala. She's been giving tours of her hometown for over 30 years, making sure that time is never forgotten. She took us on a tour recently for 's series on the civil rights generation. So we wanted to check on her now that Selma is hurting, hit by devastating storms and a tornado that recently swept across the region. JoAnne Bland joins us now. And I just want to say, like, I am so sorry, and we are all so sorry to hear about what's happened to Selma. Well, it's devastating. It hurts so bad to see my beloved home look like it is. In all my years, I've not experienced this, but it's bad. Can you give us a sense of what the damage is like? I saw some videos, and I'm - the thing about being in - when we were down in Selma, it was so historic. And I know you knew every inch of it. I can't imagine being in your position, seeing the damage. Yeah. The neighborhoods are the ones that are hurt the most, not to mention the loss of businesses and stuff. But the neighborhoods where I grew up walking those streets and seeing those same houses that are now gone or flattened or have no roofs. The only consolation we have is that God saw fit to spare us the loss of life. Thankfully, there was no loss of life, but I know people have lost homes. How are people coping? Well, when you start off being one of the poorest places in America, any devastation throws us for a loop. It's hard to come back from any tragedy, and this has to be the worst we've ever had. Most of the houses that were destroyed a lot of people owned. Some had insurance, but the majority of the people were renting. And most didn't have insurance, and most didn't have - frankly, didn't have anywhere to go when this hit with no funds to get there. It reminded me so much of Katrina that even though people were alive, they still had nowhere to go. It broke my heart to find families, families living in cars that some - that had been destroyed in the tornado. And how are you doing? How are you holding up? Because it's clear just in the time that I was with you that your heart is tied up in Selma. Don't make me cry. My hometown - I love it. And I've spent my life trying to make it a better place. And it seems as though you make one step forward, and you get knocked back two. But I'm up to the challenge. I'm up to the challenge. And I have thousands of friends who will help to support us here. But those of you hearing the sound of my voice who can - who know me know I love Selma and that I'm going to do everything I can. But I need your help. We need hands. We need - just think of Selma in what it's given the world. And please give something back. I know that you always do the ceremony and the march on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday. Is that still going to happen? Is that still the plan? Yes, it is. We can't let it stop. First of all, from the bridge down about three blocks down Broad Street, nothing happened. OK. And Brown Chapel's intact, so there's no reason we should not continue the jubilee. This would be a chance for people to come and support us and give something back to Selma. That's JoAnne Bland, who runs Journeys for the Soul tours in Selma, Ala. Thank you so very much. No, thank you for having me. Yeah. And God bless you. And God bless Selma. Pray for Selma, please.

The federal government pays for the vast majority of that research, but funding has fallen by a third - a loss of nearly $3 billion - over the past two decades. As Harvest Public Media's Dana Cronin reports, that decline has implications for agriculture's ability to adapt to climate change. Gwyn Beattie tugs open the frosty door to her lab's industrial-style freezer, which houses thousands of plant and bacteria samples. It starts beeping angrily at her. And you can't have it open too long or else it beeps at you and says, I don't want to warm up. Beattie is a professor of plant pathology at Iowa State University. She recently received a $750,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to study drought resiliency in crops, a subject of increasing importance. There's not a sustainable amount of available fresh water for agriculture everywhere in the way we're going. So we really need plants that can thrive with less water. But federal funding for that research is becoming more scarce. According to the USDA, funding levels for public agriculture research are hovering around $5 billion. That's on par with 1970s-era funding. Meanwhile, China has surpassed the U.S. in its agriculture research funding. Brazil, a major competitor in ag exports, has also increased its funding.Beth Ford is the CEO of ag giant Land O'Lakes. Speaking at a recent public event, she said she's worried the U.S. is falling behind in preparing for agriculture's stark future. We're going to have less arable land, less available water in the future. We know this. And at the same time, the population's set to go to 9 1/2, 10 billion. By 2050, we have to produce more food than the last 5,000 years combined. That should be an eye opener, she says. But while public funding for ag research has fallen over the past two decades, private funding, from companies like Land O'Lakes, has shot up. Iowa State University, for example, has seen a 50% increase in company-funded research over just the last two years. And agriculture has been at the forefront of that.Gabrielle Roesch-McNally does agricultural research with American Farmland Trust, a nonprofit that promotes environmentally friendly farming. She says relying on corporations for funding could skew the overall research agenda.- They're looking for ways that research can develop products - you know, tangible, intangible - that people will spend money on, that will increase their base of profit. Research is a public good, she says, and it should mostly be up to the federal government to fund it. Those public research dollars are determined by Congress via the Farm Bill, which is set for reauthorization this year.Congresswoman Chellie Pingree sits on the agriculture appropriations subcommittee. She says getting more dollars for ag research can be a tough sell with some of her colleagues. It's kind of abstract. It's not like direct funding to a program that puts, you know, milk in kids' lunches or, you know, things that people see as directly providing a service. She hopes this year's Farm Bill reauthorization, though, brings renewed attention to the issue. Farm Bill hearings have already begun. For NPR News, I'm Dana Cronin.

Polar bear patrols can help,Ayesha Rascoe,"One consequence of climate change and a warming planet - polar bears are spending more time on land instead of Arctic ice. This means more interactions with humans. Scientists say attacks are rare, but last week, a mother and child were tragically killed by a polar bear in a remote Alaskan village. According to the Associated Press, the incident has residents talking about reviving polar bear patrols. Such patrols raise awareness about humans coexisting with polar bears and try to protect both bears and humans. The AP reports that some tactics used by patrollers to keep polar bears at bay include gently revving snowmobiles or firing beanbags from shotguns. In Russia, one patrol group placed walrus carcasses far from villages to lure bears away. And in Canada, polar bears that can't be frightened off are captured and cared for in chilled environments called bear jails until they can be safely flown back to the ice. Funding has been an obstacle over the years, but there is renewed hope more will be done to encourage these programs. ",Animals

Here's why,"Lisa Hagen, Jeff Brady","An interview with a federal official set off a culture war fight after he suggested regulators might put stricter scrutiny on gas cooking stoves due to health concerns. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption, An interview with a federal official set off a culture war fight after he suggested regulators might put stricter scrutiny on gas cooking stoves due to health concerns., At the beginning of January, the health and climate effects of gas cooking stoves in homes was an issue policy makers and academics were studying., Then, on Jan. 9, Bloomberg News published an interview with Richard Trumka, Jr., a commissioner on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, who suggested that the government might consider stricter regulation of new gas stoves in response to health concerns about indoor air quality., Within days, those stoves had become fodder for partisan influencers and campaign merchandise., ""God. Guns. Gas Stoves,"" wrote U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, (R-Ohio) on Twitter., Florida Gov. Ron Desantis' political organization quickly came out with aprons for sale in the style of a yellow Gadsden flag, once an icon of the Tea Party, but with a gas stove where the rattlesnake usually sits., ""Not only is Biden coming for your paycheck, he is coming for your stove. You heard me right. The White House is now attempting to ban all gas ovens and burners,"" said Fox News host Sean Hannity., Each of these pro-stove declarations came after Trumka had already clarified that the agency ""isn't coming for anyone's gas stoves."", The discussion over more strict regulation of gas stoves comes amid a growing body of research that children and others with breathing problems such as asthma can experience short and maybe even long-term health effects from gas cooking stoves in their home., This week, the American Public Health Association issued a statement calling the appliances ""a public health concern,"" and called on federal agencies to do more to educate the public about those health risks and to conduct further research. Additionally, scientists who study climate change generally agree that household use of natural gas, a fossil fuel, will have to be dramatically curtailed if the U.S. is to reach its decarbonization goals., The natural gas industry, utilities and appliance manufacturers have faced such criticisms decades before their cause was taken up by politicians and influencers., The reaction from politically-inclined actors was to adopt gas stove-themed versions of the popular gun rights slogan, ""Come and take it."", ""It's this really well developed reflex among hyperpartisan media outlets and influencers doing what it does best, which is isolating a situation, misrepresenting it and then stoking outrage. And using that to entertain its audience,"" says Jared Holt, a senior research manager at the nonprofit Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which studies extremism and political polarization., Holt said he thinks of each cycle of performed outrage as individual drum beats in song. In his view, gas stoves are incidental to repeatedly practicing rituals of resentment, cynicism and ridicule toward regulation and groups considered hostile to conservatives., The outrage also generates money, power and attention for many people. ""My gas stove identifies as electric,"" read a post from one TikTok user last week in which she calmly sets a couple of her gas stove burners on high before sipping what looks like white wine. The post, which plays on narratives that liberal positions on gender and regulation are absurd, was viewed nearly two million times., While collecting views and likes on social media can seem like juvenile motivations, Holt points to figures on the right who have figured out how to fan the flames to become prominent, hyper-partisan influencers. Moments like these are opportunities for anyone with a book or T-shirt to sell, or tales of conspiracy to promote., ""If it's paying the bills, that's a pretty good incentive for most people, I think. Especially if it's giving you power and access to big amounts of influence,"" says Holt., The furor came from framing the debate around the word ""ban,"" says Melissa Aronczyk, a professor at Rutgers University who's written about public relations and strategic communication in the fight against environmental regulation., ""So I think that a word like 'ban' activates a series of cascading frames. You can't tell us what to do. You can't come into my home and take away my things. Why are you passing judgment on my lifestyle choices?"" says Aronczyk., Similar framings were used around the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, she says, when conservatives opposed to it referred to it as ""a command and control institution."" Aronczyk says those arguments framed addressing environmental problems as an economic trade off., As the right-wing furor about gas stoves heated up last week, Fox News ran segments featuring restaurant owners saying a gas stove ban would destroy the food services industry. Aronczyk says for decades, many of the most dedicated activists in environmental movements have believed that collecting and presenting scientific evidence would motivate people to join up and take action. That's definitely not been the case, she says., Meanwhile, she says, PR firms and marketers for the natural gas industry have worked on creating positive associations with their products through campaigns like ""cooking with gas,"" which included hiring chefs to convey a message that being a good cook means cooking with gas. It's part of a playbook, says Aronczyk, that essentially hasn't changed since it was being used by the tobacco industry in the 1960's and 70's., An argument about cooking at home is much more tangible than the complexity of how gas stoves may contribute over time to climate change or public health. Those causes are about collective action and collective harms. ""They're remote and they're abstract and they're out there in the future,"" says Arie Kruglanski, a psychology professor at the University of Maryland., The Consumer Product Safety Commission is set to open an information gathering process on gas burning stoves in March.","NA"

Puskar/AP hide caption, A display of Starbucks coffee pods at a Costco Warehouse in Pennsylvania. A recent article says using coffee pods might be better for the climate, but the science is far from settled. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar), You may have come across news headlines about coffee this week, like this one from the ""Coffee pod carbon footprint better for planet than filtered brew."", The stories are about a short article published earlier this month that says single-use coffee pods may be better for the climate than other forms of coffee preparation., The coverage by social media and news outlets came as good news to lots of people who have single-use coffee makers, since they've heard for years that the disposable metal and plastic capsules in their machines harm the environment. Columnist Matthew Yglesias tweeted out: ""Vindication""., The problem is, the positive take on coffee pods and the climate might not be true., Despite the hype, it's hard to know how solid the conclusions are in the article that blew up online this week. That's in part because the article isn't a formal study that has been peer-reviewed, which means it hasn't been vetted yet by other experts in the field. The article's lead author, Luciano Rodrigues Viana, a doctoral student at the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi, said in an email to NPR that he hopes to release a peer-reviewed study soon., And research into the climate impact of coffee pods isn't settled. Viana's article says that coffee pods may have less emissions than other forms of coffee preparation. But a peer-reviewed paper from 2021 found the complete opposite: that coffee pods account for more emissions than other ways of making coffee, because of greenhouse gases from producing the pods' packaging and dealing with the waste., Media scholars who study climate change aren't surprised by the hot takes on the article., Headlines that say single-use coffee pods may be ""environmentally friendly"" have a lot of allure, says Max Boykoff, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado Boulder., ""Novelty can really drive a news story,"" Boykoff says. ""Something that could be seen as counterintuitive, that would grab people's attention."", The issue is that these kind of media stories can sidetrack us from the big picture of planet-heating emissions, and the much bigger sources of pollution than your coffee cup, Boykoff says., ""Shaming one another about the ways in which we brew coffee or whether we drink coffee at all, I think, actually, really does some damage and distracts us from some real challenges at hand, some real work that ought to be done."", Viana, the lead author, says he didn't expect this media attention. Earlier this month, he and his colleagues published their analysis comparing filtered coffee, French press coffee, instant coffee and coffee in single-use pods. They found that coffee pods may have less of an environmental impact than the other methods, because they may waste less water and coffee, and the machines may also use less electricity. Viana notes similar findings have also been published by a few other researchers., But now the article has taken on a life of its own – it's even spawned at least one popular TikTok., ""I would like to clarify something,"" Viana writes in an email. ""We did not write this article to encourage people to use pods/capsules (we even suggest using reusable capsules) or to stop drinking coffee. The goal was to focus on the major problems with coffee consumption at the consumer level."", But emissions in coffee consumption don't just come down to the consumer, Boykoff says. He says media coverage of what's driving emissions also has to take into account the role of larger companies. When it comes to single-use coffee, that means companies like Keurig Dr Pepper or Nespresso, corporations that make many of the plastic and metal pods consumers use., Keurig Dr Pepper uses plastic to produce their pods. In addition to being difficult to recycle, plastic is derived from fossil fuels. A Keurig Dr Pepper spokesperson said data on the greenhouse gas emissions of their pods is proprietary information, and said in an email that they ""remain focused on improving the sustainability attributes of our Keurig brewing system."", Nespresso, owned by Nestle, makes coffee pods primarily from aluminum, says Anna Marciano, head of sustainability and general counsel for Nespresso USA. She says the company works with municipalities like New York City on its recycling infrastructure for the aluminum pods and is also piloting a program for compostable coffee pods in Europe., Nespresso spends more than $35 million annually on a coffee pod recycling program, according to Marciano. ""It's not something that we're not investing in,"" she says., And how much actually gets recycled in the U.S.? ""We could be anywhere from 36% to 37% on a national basis,"" Marciano says., Ultimately, climate media scholars worry that too much attention over individual actions like using coffee pods can distract us from climate solutions that can have a greater impact, like regulating the wider plastic or fossil fuel industries, says Jill Hopke, associate professor of journalism at DePaul University., ""And we can just get so mired up in this kind of accounting, right?"" Hopke says. ""Losing the bigger picture of what kind of societal changes do we need to make."", Boykoff, whose research has looked at the impact of media on climate action, says in the grand scheme of individual actions we can take on climate, reducing coffee intake isn't at the top of his list., ""Would my environmental impact be greater if I stopped eating meat today or if I stopped drinking coffee?"" he asks. ""I think the answer is clearly whether one chooses to eat meat or not.""",Climate
https://www.npr.org/2023/01/21/1150548999/logging-is-one-of-the-many-industries-affected-by-higher-temperatures-this-winte,2023-01-21,Logging is one of the many industries affected by higher temperatures this winter,Henry Epp,"It's been an unusually warm winter in the Northeast, and one of the many industries affected by the high temperatures is logging. Loggers need frozen ground to reach some forested areas. But Henry Epp from Vermont Public reports the ground just hasn't been frozen. Brian Lafoe is operating a machine called a forwarder in a patch of woods in East Burke, a small town in northeastern Vermont. He maneuvers a mechanized arm to pick up logs that his son-in-law felled, split and piled along a road they cut through the forest. The heavy machinery has left ruts in the ground. Usually that's not an issue at this time of year. In the wintertime, you got this wet ground, the ground is froze up. Our machines go over it good. We don't do no damage. But on this sunny January morning, the temperature is starting to rise above freezing. And that means Lafoe can't run the forwarder much longer or else he'll start to damage the soil. Winter is a crucial season for loggers like Lafoe. Typically, the frozen ground allows them to access sensitive wooded areas like this nearly every day. But this year, temperatures surged into the 50s in early January, and there's mud and ice where there should be deep snow. You shouldn't be able to see this ground. We should have snow right now. Life should be good. It should be zero degrees. We should be going. Instead, this job has taken Lafoe about two weeks longer than normal, and he'll have to do more work in the summer to repair the rutted logging trails. All told, he guesses the weather will increase his costs by about 17%. Luckily, he paid off all his equipment, like the forwarder, years ago. I guess a good way to put it, if I didn't own all this stuff, I probably wouldn't be doing it right now. I'd be retired. But I think this is shades of things to come. This is David Senio, the forester working with Brian Lafoe on this project. With climate change, winters are becoming shorter and more unpredictable in Vermont. Cutting down trees which store carbon could be adding to that climate impact. But Senio argues there's also a climate-positive effect of logging. Responsibly managing forests can make them healthier in the long run. But warming winters limit how often loggers can do that work. How do you make more productive days in a year? You don't. And, Senio says, all of Vermont's $1.4 billion forest products industry is impacted by the changing climate - not just loggers, but sawmill operators, too. Goodridge Lumber in Albany, Vt., relies on loggers like Brian Lafoe for the wood that's running through their sawmill. Workers feed white cedar logs along a spinning saw blade, cutting them into posts and boards. But because loggers haven't been able to harvest as much this year, owner Colleen Goodridge says her sawmill's store of fresh logs is running low. This year, we don't have that extra inventory that we had last year. So we are hoping that, you know, we have a strong next few weeks. Sales are good right now, Goodridge says, but it's not clear how long that will last. She's thinking of ways to diversify her business, like finding markets for lower-quality wood. Still, she's trying to be optimistic about the rest of the season. I'm hopeful. And, you know, we've had cold weather in April. We've had Aprils that hung on and hung on and hung on. So we just don't know. Goodridge has been in the lumber business for 49 years. Her sons are now co-owners. But she's worried about the future of this industry in Vermont. High costs and the unpredictability of a changing climate make it a tough business for young people to enter. One of the many challenges of life - they say, you know, to live is to experience change. Well, you know, I guess we're living. Goodridge just hopes the logging industry can adapt to all this change.For NPR News, I'm Henry Epp in northern Vermont. ",Climate

In New Hampshire's capital city of Concord, where Davis lives, it's been warm and rainy – though he got his wish Friday for a good dumping of snow., As the climate changes, winter is the fastest-warming season for much of the U.S., and New England is a hot spot. This year is no exception, and Davis says snowplow businesses are feeling the impacts., Of 246 locations in the U.S. analyzed by Climate Central, winter is warming the fastest. Climate Central hide caption, Of 246 locations in the U.S. analyzed by Climate Central, winter is warming the fastest., Most of the year, Davis and his small team reseal driveways, fill cracks in the road, and paint stripes onto parking lots. But in the winter, he relies on plowing snow to make money. At the start of the season, he gathered up customers, and said he'd take care of their driveways when it snows more than three inches., In December, the first storm came., ""I was out there, every snowflake, with my tape measure in the snow, like, 'Oh, we're at an inch and a half. It's almost time to go out!'"" he recalls. ""It just felt really good when I dropped the plow for the first time."", Opportunities to plow have been few and far between, since that first storm. Friday's snow was the second time this winter Davis has plowed his entire 20-stop route., ""It's nice that we got it (snow), but I am a bit disappointed that we haven't had too much more. So hopefully things will start looking up,"" he says, driving home from his 6-hour shift Friday morning., For the first time, Davis paid one of his clients to ride along and help shovel during Friday's storm. He plans to keep doing this for big storms – but when it only snows a little, Davis says he'll do the work himself., Right now, his summer employees find other winter work. He'd like to offer them year-round jobs, but at the moment he can't guarantee them a steady winter income., ""I'm really still wracking my mind about what else can I do to obviously keep my employees employed and to keep my family supported throughout the wintertime, instead of just trying to save money in the summertime,"" he says., Davis charges per visit. If it snows a foot, he can make a few thousand dollars. He says it'll take about four snowstorms to see a return on his investment in the plow. and another five storms for the truck. But for much of the winter, it's been raining instead of snowing. ""You can't plow a puddle,"" he says. ""No one wants you to go plow a puddle."", Puddles are increasingly common. Mary Stampone, New Hampshire's state climatologist, says there are more and more days when it's not cold enough to snow., ""With the warmer temperatures comes a change in the type of precipitation, where we have more precipitation falling as rain during the winter season,"" she says., Snowstorms, when they happen, are getting more intense, says Astrid Caldas, a senior climate scientist focused on community resilience at the Union of Concerned Scientists. That's because warm air can hold more moisture., ""A lot of people, when they have these huge snowstorms, they say, how can it be global warming?"" she says. ""That's exactly what's expected under global warming, because there is more water vapor in the air to come down as rain or snow."", Winter warming also contributes to the kind of ""lake effect"" snow Buffalo, NY saw earlier this winter. With lakes freezing over later, warm lake water can combine with cold air to create heavy snow., Even with major snowstorms, without consistently cold temperatures the snow is likely to melt, Caldas says., ""It's not going to contribute to the snowpack, and many places depend on snowpack for a variety of water uses,"" she explains., Concord has already lost about a week of snow cover in the last 50 years, according to the state's latest climate assessment. By mid-century, the area could lose more than a month of snow cover. A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could lessen snow loss, according to the report., The New Hampshire Department of Transportation says it's been kind of a relief to have less snow this season. It has a lot of open positions, and volunteers from other parts of the agency are relied on to help plow state roads when there's a storm., They're not alone. States across the country have struggled with a lack of snowplow drivers., But as New Hampshire's winters get warmer, Davis says smaller snowplow businesses are feeling the pinch., ""I think it's already clear to people that you can't count on snow plowing,"" he says. ""It's been clear for a few seasons now."", Davis worries about climate change. He doesn't want to see winter disappear, not only because it affects his business, but also because he loves snowboarding. He wants to share that experience with future generations., ""Not just my son, but his kids should be learning how to snowboard and have fun in the winters and not be like, 'Oh, well, when my grandfather was around they actually snowboarded that mountain,'"" he says. ""That's a sad thought to think about."", Even if storms are less frequent, Davis says he'll keep his equipment. He wants to help people make sure they can get out of their driveways if they get snowed in. Plus, he says, a plow truck is a nice place to be, during a storm., ""Watching the sun rise over all the trees covered in snow, and the way that the sun glistens off of it,"" Davis says.

And now there's some hope against one of those threats. Emily Jones of member station WABE reports on the world's first honeybee vaccine. On Marcus Pollard's farm just south of Atlanta, the bees are hunkered down for winter. What they do when it is cold, they cluster around the queen to keep her warm and the cluster of bees warm. And they just go around and eat honey. It's a mild day for January, so Pollard can open up the bee boxes without hurting them. He talks over Zoom as he points his phone camera inside a healthy colony. The bees crawl all over, busy making honey for winter. It would be a different story if these bees picked up the bacteria that causes American foulbrood. As soon as you would open it up, you would get a very rancid smell. The bees inside would die, leaving behind a sticky residue filled with bacteria. That puts all the nearby hives at risk because bees could visit and take the deadly bacteria back to their colonies. So Pollard says there's no choice but to burn an infected hive. It can wipe out my entire operation, you know, in a week or two. That's one reason a new vaccine developed by biotech firm Dalan Animal Health could be a game changer. The U.S. Department of Agriculture gave the vaccine a conditional license earlier this month. That means there's an urgent need for it as testing continues. The vaccine works by feeding a safe version of the American foulbrood or AFB pathogen to queen bees. University of Georgia bee expert Keith Delaplane says the queen then passes it on. Each egg has particles of the AFB bacterium so that the adult that emerges from that egg is born primed for immunity against that pathogen. Whole colonies of bees then become immune to the disease. American foulbrood is just one threat to honeybees. Climate change can shift where their favorite plants grow and harm bee habitat. Warmer temperatures also help mosquitoes spread. Delaplane says that can mean more people spraying insecticides where honeybees live. You know, that doesn't do them any good. Plus, plenty of other diseases can devastate bees. That's one reason scientists are so excited about this vaccine. It could lead to more bee health breakthroughs. For NPR News, I'm Emily Jones. ",Animals

Of the world's roughly 7,000 spoken languages, one dies every 40 days, according to one estimate - languages like Babanki, spoken in Cameroon... #1: (Speaking Babanki). ...Or Nalik, heard on an island in Papua New Guinea. #2: (Speaking Nalik). And some of the places where rare languages are the most concentrated are also most vulnerable to climate change. Linguists call global warming the final nail in the coffin for more than half of humanity's languages. Karen McVeigh wrote about this for The Guardian. Welcome. Thank you. Let's start with a specific example. Tell us about the island nation of Vanuatu. Vanuatu is a South Pacific island nation. It's very small, but it has 110 languages spoken there, which is the highest density of languages in the world. And it's also one of the nation's most vulnerable to climate change. Exactly. It is also one of the countries most at risk of sea level rise and climate change. And here, you find this kind of sort of perfect storm. Linguists see that many small linguistic communities - perhaps there's only 100 people speak the language or something like that - are on islands and coastlines vulnerable to hurricanes, to weather and sea level rise. And so if rising seas or storms displace those people and they wind up in - I don't know - Indonesia or Australia, what happens to the language that those hundred people speak? Well, what often happens is that they aren't necessarily displaced with the same people in their community, and also, even if they are displaced with other people in their community, the children will often adopt the language of, you know, Indonesia or Australia or whatever, the dominant language there because they get - it's economically advantageous for them to speak the new language, the dominant language. And the language kind of dies. A language is much more than words. Like, I'm thinking about the specificity of Yiddish curses. There's one that says, all his teeth should fall out except one to make him suffer. Like, that's such a Yiddish way of viewing the world. Yeah. And so is the loss of the language itself just a small piece of what's happening? I think absolutely it is because the language carries so much local knowledge and culture. Like, there's a single word in Greenlandic, which is vulnerable but still spoken. And translated, it means something like a strong afternoon wind that comes from the fjord. But it has more than that. It's a very kind of specific meaning. When locals translate it, they say something like, the wind in the fjord that comes in from the sea, and it can be hard to get home, but once you're out of the fjord, it's nice weather. So they're describing a local weather pattern. Yeah. Yeah. So it describes so much more. There's so much culturally lost when a language dies. What did you learn about efforts to slow this trend? Well, there have been massive efforts, particularly in Hawaii and also in New Zealand. In the 1970s, it was something like 2,000 native speakers of Hawaiian remained. But activists launched these immersion schools where children are taught from birth, usually by kind of grandparents, and now more than 18,700 people speak it. And the same thing happened in New Zealand in the 1970s. Only 5% of young Maori people spoke the language, but now something like 25% now speak it.

New Hampshire Public Radio's Mara Hoplamazian took a ride recently with someone feeling the impact from climate change - a snowplow driver. Harold Davis keeps his phone close by. In the summer, he's the guy you call to reseal your driveway, fill in cracks in the pavement or paint stripes onto a parking lot. In the winter, he's the guy you call when snow starts to fall. When it storms, he's out all day. It's 20 stops. It's 56 driving miles. Typically, say, 10 minutes average a stop. It's going to take around six hours. Davis bought his plow and a used truck a few months ago. This is his first season with his own equipment. He spent about a decade working for other snow removal businesses when it gets too cold to do his usual work. He takes care of about 20 homes whenever it snows more than three inches. In December, the first storm came to Concord, New Hampshire's capital city, where Davis lives. He went out with a tape measure. Oh, we're at an inch and a half. It's almost time to go out. Two inches. And then it was like three. And I'm like - you know, I already had the truck cleaned off and started, of course. And it just felt really good when I dropped the plow for the first time. That's been the only storm this season big enough for him to plow his entire route. Davis charges per visit. If it snows a foot, he can make a few thousand dollars. He says it'll take about four snowstorms to see a return on his investment in the plow and another five storms for the truck. But driving his usual route, on this day, Davis sees only bare driveways. You know, rain in a snowstorm melts the snow, and you can't plow a puddle. No one wants you to go plow a puddle, so... Puddles are increasingly common. Winter is the fastest-warming season for most of the country. New Hampshire's state climatologist Mary Stampone says that means there are more days when it's not cold enough to snow.

Relentless storms from a series of atmospheric rivers have saturated the mountains and hillsides scarred from wildfires along much of California's coastline., California has relatively young mountains from a geology standpoint, meaning much of its steep terrain is still in motion and covered in loose rocks and soil that can be sloughed off easily, especially when the ground is wet, according to geologists., Almost all of the state has received rainfall totals of 400% to 600% above average since Christmas, with some areas receiving as much as 30 inches of precipitation, causing massive flooding. The severe weather has killed at least 19 people since late December., Since New Year's Eve, the California Department of Conservation's landslide mapping team has documented more than 300 landslides., The state's prolonged drought has made matters worse., Dan Shugar, an associate professor of geoscience at the University of Calgary, said drought can have a counterintuitive effect when combined with the incredible rainfall California has seen in recent days., ""You'd think if the ground is dry it should be able to absorb a lot of water, but when ground becomes too dry, the permeability of the ground actually decreases,"" he said. As water runs off the hardened soil, moving downward and picking up energy, it can begin carrying soil and debris away, he said., Added to that, wildfires have left some hillsides with little to no vegetation to hold the soil in place., A firefighter stands on the roof of a house submerged in mud and rocks, Jan. 10, 2018, in Montecito, Calif. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP hide caption, A firefighter stands on the roof of a house submerged in mud and rocks, Jan. 10, 2018, in Montecito, Calif., The most vulnerable areas are hillsides that have burned in the past two to three years with communities below them, said Jeremy Lancaster, who leads the California Department of Conservation's geological and landslide mapping team., That includes areas that recently burned in Napa, Mariposa, and Monterey counties, he said., In 2018, the deadly mudslides in Montecito occurred about a month after one of the largest fires in California's history tore through the same area, charring 280,000 acres., Montecito is sandwiched between the Santa Ynez mountains and the Pacific coast. On the fifth anniversary of that tragedy, the entire community was ordered to evacuate on Jan. 9 as rains pummeled the area and debris blocked roads., Lancaster warned that the threat of landslides will linger long after the rains have subsided as the water seeps 50 to 100 feet into the soil, dislodging things., ""They can occur weeks later, if not months,"" he said., A bulldozer moves debris as a vehicle sits stranded in flooded water on U.S. Highway 101 in Montecito, Calif., Jan. 10, 2018. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP hide caption, A bulldozer moves debris as a vehicle sits stranded in flooded water on U.S. Highway 101 in Montecito, Calif., Jan. 10, 2018., Lancaster said California has dramatically increased its efforts to identify hotspots since the Montecito mudslides. His department continually updates its map so local communities are aware and can make decisions, including whether to evacuate an entire community., The state is also working on a system to better pinpoint how much rain might trigger a landslide., Marten Geertsema, who studies natural hazards and terrain analysis at the University of Northern British Columbia, said agencies use a variety of tools to gauge the likelihood of landslides in a given area, including terrain maps and lidar – pulsed light from lasers to penetrate foliage to see the ground. Then they can watch for early warnings, such as changes over time in photos taken from the air, or from satellites, or in data from GPS monitoring stations, tilt meters and or other on-site instrumentation., Netting made from metal cables is visible above a creek in Montecito, Calif., on Jan. 12, 2023.

Ty O'Neil/AP hide caption, Netting made from metal cables is visible above a creek in Montecito, Calif., on Jan. 12, 2023. With climate change predicted to produce more severe weather, officials are scrambling to put in basins, nets and improve predictions of where landslides might occur to keep homes and people safe., One of the best ways to manage landslides is with debris basins – pits carved out of the landscape to catch material flowing downhill., But basins, which can require a lot of land, can also disrupt the natural ecosystem and lead to beaches needing to be replenished by collecting sediment that flows out of the canyons, according to experts., And they are costly, said Douglas Jerolmack, a professor of environmental science and mechanical engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. And if old debris isn't removed, they can be overwhelmed by new landslides or mudslides., Some might also not be big enough to deal with future slides worsened by climate change, Jerolmack said., After the 2018 mudslides hit Montecito, the Los Angeles Times reported that debris basins above the community were undersized and hadn't been sufficiently emptied., The tragedy galvanized the community, which raised millions to address the problem, said Patrick McElroy, a retired Santa Barbara fire chief who founded the nonprofit organization, The Project for Resilient Communities., The organization hired an engineering company to map the canyons and installed debris nets. He said the recent storms put them to the test: One net measuring 25 feet tall filled nearly to capacity., McElroy said he's still haunted by memories from 2018 but feels better, knowing that the community might be safer now., ""I'm not over it yet. But to wake up, you know, the other day and see no injuries and no fatalities. I just can't tell you how impressed I am,"" he said of the nets., The best solution for the Montecito and Santa Barbara area is to have both nets and debris basins, according to Larry Gurrola, the engineering geologist hired by the organization., But nothing is cheap. Santa Barbara County's spent $20 million on a new basin after 2018, while McElroy's organization spent close to $2 million on installing the nets, which includes liability insurance and other fees. They have a five-year permit for the nets, which will be removed if it is not renewed., Gurrola said the alternative is more costly. With the recent storms, more than half of California's 58 counties have been declared disaster areas and repairing the damage may cost more than $1 billion., ""Most importantly these things protect the community and save lives,"" he said.",Climate

The parade of heavy rainstorms is continuing, and evacuations have been ordered near Monterey on the Central Coast. Nineteen people have died across the state, and the damages are likely to hit hundreds of millions of dollars. We were wondering if there's a lesson to be learned from these storms and if there is something California and other states can do to be better prepared, especially as the climate changes. Lauren Sommer from NPR's Climate Desk is here to answer that, and she's with us now. Lauren, thanks so much for joining us. Yeah. Thanks. So right now, the problem is just too much water. But paradoxically, California is still in a multiyear drought. Have the storms helped with that? The drought has improved. You know, new federal data shows that the overall severity of the drought is less, but the entire state is still in some form of drought. Reservoirs are filling up. But after several years of these historically dry conditions, they started out extremely low. So is there something that California could be doing to save some of this heavy rainfall and help alleviate the drought? I think it's something that's on everybody's mind. Right. Exactly. Yeah. And there is a new approach that is being tried out. Typically, reservoirs in the West have to release water in the winter because they're required to have empty space. That way, you know, if a big storm hits, the dams aren't overwhelmed and possibly fail. But that hasn't worked out great when there weren't any big storms because they lost water they didn't need to. So now there are two reservoirs that are using the weather forecast instead of those automatic rolls. And they only will empty out if more storms are coming. Marty Ralph, who studies reservoirs at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, says, you know, this could make a difference this year. We have to use every drop of water that much more effectively. There's not much to spare. Climate change is a thing that's evolving the extremes here. Well, to that point, should California expect to see more of this kind of weather with climate change? How much more extreme are the extremes going to get? The phrase people are using is weather whiplash - so longer, more intense dry periods and then more extreme storms. You know, that's something climate scientists like Daniel Swain of UCLA expect to see more of as things get hotter because warmer air can hold more moisture so the rainfall gets more intense, he says. The degree to which climate change has made this storm sequence or storm sequences like it wetter in California is anywhere from about 5% on the low end to 15% more intense on the high end. And that may not sound like a lot, but that can result in large increases in the relative amount of runoff we see during these events. And as bad as this storm has seemed, it's actually not the worst-case scenario. He says weather records show even more extreme storms are very possible with climate change. So if California needs to prepare for something even worse, does your reporting indicate what it should be focusing on to reduce the damage and the destruction from flooding? Yeah. The key thing to focus on is our built environment. You know, we tend to treat rivers like they never change, right? We build right up to the river front. But that hems them in, and it gives floodwaters nowhere to go. So there is a movement now to give rivers more room to, you know, move the levees back, restore the natural space around them. That's tough to do, of course, because it involves buying out people's properties. But, you know, the momentum is growing because people are realizing if the weather is getting more dynamic, our environment needs to build in that kind of leeway, too. That's Lauren Sommer from NPR's Climate Desk. Lauren, thank you so much. Yeah. Thank you. ",National

Raw sewage has gushed through neighborhoods, flooded roadways, poured into San Francisco Bay. Officials urge residents not to swim in the bay or even jump in puddles. Lesley McClurg from member station KQED explains the toxic disaster has revealed deficiencies in an aging sewer system. The rain that fell in recent weeks was like a fire hose blasting debris through neighborhoods along roadways and out to the bay. Mary Spicer steps through a heap of garbage washed up on a beach in Oakland. I got to watch my step. Oh, so corrosives. This is a Nabisco Easy Cheese. Spicer tosses the rusty can. She usually spends the morning kayaking along the estuary. But right now, she won't even touch the water. I'm really upset. I'm very angry. And I'm really - this garbage, that sewage goes directly into our most precious resource - our bay, our water, our ocean. And I think it's almost criminal to ignore it. At least 22 million gallons of raw sewage have spilled into the environment since the storms began. That's enough to fill at least 33 Olympic swimming pools. And that's just the tally from official reports. There's utilities that have had large unauthorized discharges that haven't even reported yet. Eileen White is the executive officer of San Francisco's Water Quality Control Board. I think they're still in the response mode. They're getting ready for the next storm. White says the pipes that carry sewage from homes to treatment facilities are cracked and riddled with holes that allow rainwater to seep in. Oakland recently recorded its wettest day on record, overwhelming multiple points at the system. Andrea Pook is a spokesperson for the East Bay Municipal Utility District. The huge influx of rainwater exceeded our ability to move and treat that wastewater. It overflowed before it even got to our system. Nearby in Castro Valley, residents reported wastewater backing up into their drains and toilet paper flooding their yards. To replace pipes in that community of just 65,000 people, it's estimated to cost around $500 million. Raw sewage contains pathogens, bacteria and viruses that can make humans and wildlife sick. Often, people don't think about replacing pipes until it's too late.- Pipes are underground. They're not sexy. They're out of sight, out of mind. Sejal Choksi-Chugh is the executive director of Baykeeper, a local environmental group.CHOKSI- City councils just don't tend to prioritize funding maintenance of these pipes and making sure that they're upgraded and maintained properly. She says preventing another disaster requires multiple fixes. First, residents need to repair private lines. Then, cities need to update old underground municipal clay pipes. And finally, outdated wastewater treatment plants need to be overhauled. Just last summer, the Bay Area experienced an unprecedented red tide leading to massive fish kills during a heat wave. It was likely driven by utilities discharging too much treated sewage into the bay.CHOKSI- So we've got wastewater treatment plants responsible for both of these really big problems. And I'm really hoping that this is a wake-up call for the wastewater industry and for the local government agencies to say we need to invest in better infrastructure around the Bay Area. Choksi-Chugh says the neighborhoods that are most susceptible to flooding are those closest to the bay shore where the sewage is discharged - often low-income communities of color. Scientists say torrential rain events mixed with harsh droughts are the new normal. And utilities must prepare for ongoing climate whiplash. For NPR News, I'm Lesley McClurg in Oakland. ",Climate

COP 28 will be in the United Arab Emirates. They get to choose. Their pick - Sultan al-Jaber spoke today at an energy forum in Abu Dhabi. NPR's Aya Batrawy joins us from the conference. Aya, we hear the noise in the background. Thanks for being with us. Thanks, Scott. How could this appointment affect climate talks. So al-Jaber is the CEO of Abu Dhabi's state-owned oil company, Adnoc. But he's also led a renewable energy company, and he's been involved in COP summit negotiations for years as the country's climate envoy. But despite his background in clean energy, his role as head of one of the world's biggest oil companies is drawing criticism from environmentalists.They say it's a conflict of interest and a cause for concern as he presides over these complex talks to reduce carbon emissions. But as CEO, a key part of his mandate is to keep pumping oil. And that forms the backbone of this country's economy. So that's at odds with international efforts to limit warming from heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Did he talk about that today? He did. But as the newly named president of the U.N. climate talks this year, he was more nuanced in tone than in past speeches where he would openly call for more investments in oil and gas. Here's some of what he said today at the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi.- We are way off track. The world is playing catch-up when it comes to the key Paris goal of holding global temperatures down to 1.5 degrees. And the hard reality is that in order to achieve this goal, global emissions must fall 43% by 2030. So this aligns with scientific studies that say to do this, the world has to rapidly phase out fossil fuels. But al-Jaber's view is that as long as the world runs on hydrocarbons, the solution isn't to immediately replace them, but to make them less carbon-intensive. Here he is again.AL- We'll work with the energy industry on accelerating the decarbonization - reducing methane and expanding hydrogen. Let's keep our focus on holding back emissions, not progress. Yeah, so basically, there's no indication the UAE's backing off on its long-term plans of pumping more oil and gas. And other major producers, like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, note that plastic and even the clothes we wear are byproducts of fossil fuels. So the transition is going to take time. Do these oil-producing countries acknowledge that the world is trying to move away from fossil fuels? I mean, absolutely. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, they want to profit from this industrial-scale transformation toward clean energy. And they're investing hundreds of billions of dollars in renewable energy. They've committed to net zero, vowing to offset and cut their emissions in the coming decades. But this only applies to emissions within their own borders and not to how their oil is being used in countries like China and India. So environmentalists say they don't accept that. And even al-Jaber himself acknowledged, as you heard, countries are moving way too slow in cutting down carbon emissions. So global temperatures are rising. It will take years to reverse this. And it's impacting food and water security right here in the Middle East, where some of the world's hottest temperatures are being recorded. NPR's Aya Batrawy, thanks so much.

More than half a dozen people died. Troy Public Radio's Kyle Gassiott joins us now from Montgomery. Kyle, thanks for being with us. Good morning, Scott. You were in Autauga County, Ala., yesterday, 35 miles north of Montgomery. This is where, unfortunately, most of the fatalities happened. Please tell us what you saw. Scott, I was in Old Kingston, the part of the county that was hit the worst. It was a formerly wooded area, and now those trees are almost completely destroyed, along with many houses and cars. When I got there, it was very cold and windy. I saw all these bonfires, which I later realized were the trees the storm had blown down being burned. One of the bonfires was in front of Cindy and John Cox's house. On Thursday, they had just come home from a doctor's visit when the alarm sounded. Cindy says they got into their safe place, and that's when she heard the tornado overhead. That is true, what they say - it does roar like a train. Kyle, how did the Coxes come through the storm? Well, Scott, Cindy was understandably scared. I was really upset in my closet and on my chair. And feeling that shake and hearing that roar, you just hope it don't take the roof with it. But the Coxes say they're grateful because they came out alive with little damage to their house. Some of their neighbors didn't make it. Kyle, for those of us who are in other parts of the country, how common are tornadoes in Alabama in January? They're common, but this type is not. I spoke with meteorologist Gerald Satterwhite, and he said, while tornadoes happen in Alabama in January, one this deadly and able to go the distance on the ground that this one went is rare. The average is around 5 miles or so. And this tornado is going to be much higher than that. We could be looking at, you know, 50 miles or more. He says debris from this tornado shot up into the air as high as 15,000 feet. And, Kyle, I understand the emergency alert the National Weather Service gave for this storm is also rare. Yeah, when the storm got to Autauga County, the Weather Service issued a tornado emergency alert, which was new to me. Satterwhite explained that this designation came about in the '90s, to describe situations in which a severe threat to human life is imminent or ongoing. And one of the first places the tornado struck was Selma, a city, of course, that is rich in the history of the civil rights movement. And traditionally, Selma holds events to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which is on Monday. Do we know if the city can still do that? Well, Scott, Selma took a hard hit from the storm. No fatalities were reported there, thankfully. But schools were closed yesterday and there's just debris everywhere. Faya Ora Rose Toure, who for the past 30 years has organized the annual bridge crossing commemorating the 1965 Bloody Sunday March for Voting Rights, called Selma a war zone. The thing about this storm - it didn't discriminate. You have low-income communities hit hard. You have middle-class communities hit hard. You have the white community hit hard. You have the Black community hit hard. You know, Scott, Dr. King spent a lot of time in Selma and participated in the march to the state capitol in Montgomery. Toure says that as destructive as this storm was, Selma still plans to hold its annual march to the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Monday. Troy Public Radio's Kyle Gassiott.

https://www.npr.org/2023/01/13/1149135808/rare-earth-minerals-deposit-found-in-sweden,2023-01-13,Rare earth minerals deposit found in Sweden,,"Sweden has announced an unusual discovery - a deposit of rare earth elements. Those minerals can be used in a number of daily items, from phones to TVs and computers to batteries. And the specific metals found in Sweden are important to making electric vehicles and wind turbines. Here to talk us through the significance of this is Planet Money's Paddy Hirsch. Hey there. Hello. So how big of a deal is this discovery? And tell us why. Well, it's a pretty big deal for Sweden. And it's a pretty big deal for the West, really, because the rare earths production and sort of generation machine is really dominated by China, which sort of generates or produces 80% of the world's rare earths, which are very important because they're used in all sorts of technology, including military technology. So having a large production facility in Sweden, that is to say a mine and a production facility, which they're talking about, is a very big deal for the West. So the mining company that found this deposit said that this is the largest one in Europe. Do you know which elements they found and what significance this holds for the global market? Well, we're not exactly sure what elements they have found yet. What they have said is that they've - they will be producing at least two elements. One is called neodymium, and the other is called praseodymium. And both of those elements are used for the production of magnets, very, very strong magnets, magnets that can be used at very, very high temperatures. And these will be used in things like electric vehicles, wind turbines, any kind of application where the temperatures get up to really, really high levels that most sort of regular magnets can't handle. So it's going to be very, very important for those kind of green technologies. And, of course, that's where we're going to see a lot of advance in, as for economically, in the next 10 to 20 years. So it's very, very important for those Western economies. You mentioned earlier that China dominates this market. So I guess I'm curious what kind of economic or - I don't know - political implications this discovery could have. Well, I mean, all sorts of implications. I mean, we have seen in the last 10 years that the U.S. in particular has been very, very worried about the fact that China has such a lock hold on the production of rare earths. And I just - I mentioned the defense issues. And we used to have a defense company in the United States that produced certain technologies using rare earths. And we shipped that wholesale to China. So now China actually produces elements that go into some of our own missile technology. And clearly that's strategically not a smart thing to happen.So the U.S. has been looking for a way - in fact, the West has been looking for a way generally to find - to tilt the balance away from China. And the U.S. is thinking about opening or working on opening a mine in the United States. We're looking at parts of Asia and Australia. So this find in Sweden is a very big deal for the West and for Western nations and NATO, who now have to worry slightly less about the fact that that balance of production of rare earths that are so strategically important has in the past been tilted towards China. Got about 30 seconds left here. Getting these elements out of the ground and to the point where they're usable can be harmful to the environment, right? So is that likely to happen? Well, Sweden has talked about having a state-of-the-art facility that will not just pull those elements out of the ores that they take out of the ground but also recycle and use the sort of the side effects, if you like - the off-throw from these for all sorts of other applications. So if they're successful in doing that, it'll be a much greener, much cleaner type of system than they have in China right now, which will be great for the environment.

https://www.npr.org/2023/01/13/1149135773/what-you-need-to-know-about-gas-stoves-and-health-risks,2023-01-13,What you need to know about gas stoves and health risks,Jeff Brady,"It's the latest tempest in a teapot on the internet and in Washington politics - what some have dubbed StoveGate. That is the idea of banning natural gas cooking stoves. The controversy started with a remark from Richard Trumka, a commissioner on the Consumer Product Safety Commission, last month before a consumer advocacy group. He cited health studies about gas stoves. That's why I think we need to be talking about regulating gas stoves, whether that's drastically improving emissions or banning gas stoves entirely. Another remark from Trumka this week has gotten some folks, including some members of Congress, all riled up on Twitter. Well, we are going to turn down the heat a little and lay out some facts. Jeff Brady from NPR's Climate Desk is here to help. Hey there. Hi. For the record, is anyone in the federal government actually planning to ban gas stoves? No. The point that Commissioner Trumka was making there is that the Consumer Product Safety Commission should keep all its options open because of the potential health consequences of these gas ranges. What the commission is doing is opening a request for information starting in March. The commission is researching gas emissions and exploring new ways to address health risks associated with stoves. Where that leads is a long way off, and Trumka is just saying that they should keep the possibility of banning gas stove available as an option. As someone who cooks on my own gas stove in my kitchen pretty regularly, what are the health risks? You know, most of us don't really think about this because we've been using gas stoves for so long. But you are burning fossil fuel. And in most cases, the pollution that comes off that blue flame goes directly into your kitchen. A lot of kitchens don't have hoods over the stove that vent outside. And even in kitchens with a good range hood, people often don't use them because they're noisy. Super noisy. Yeah. Yeah. And there have been studies on how these stoves affect indoor air quality and health. The gas utility industry, government agencies and academics have been researching this for decades. There's a growing body of evidence that children in vulnerable populations, people with asthma, for example, can experience short and maybe even long-term health effects. But it takes a lot of in-depth research for scientists to make an absolute connection between any pollutant and a disease. Now, the gas utility industry has latched on to that uncertainty to cast doubt over the research that does exist. So that's why it can be confusing to sort out what's fact and what's misinformation here. You're talking about burning fossil fuels. And I'm thinking, beyond health, are there questions here about the environment, about climate change? There are. Now, the greenhouse gas emissions from cooking aren't that much, but the gas stove is seen as a gateway appliance. Real estate agents will tell you they're a selling point. The gas utility industry has long encouraged that with its cooking-with-gas campaign. And a home with a gas range is more likely to also have a gas furnace, a water heater and a dryer. And now you're talking about more emissions. And that's why there is an effort to get homes converted to electric appliances. Those can reduce emissions if the power is produced with low carbon sources like solar, wind or nuclear. Now, outside homes, that gas stove is connected to an entire network of pipelines, compressor stations, drilling rigs. And that system leaks methane at various points from beginning to end. And methane is a very potent greenhouse gas. There are efforts underway now by governments and industry to get those leaks under control. And briefly, are we all talking about this now because of this one commissioner or are there other factors at play? There are a few other factors. There are efforts by state and local governments to limit gas use in new buildings, all in an effort to help meet their climate goals. And in that big climate-focused budget bill called the Inflation Reduction Act, there are incentives to encourage people to switch to electric. Jeff Brady from our Climate Desk. Thanks, Jeff.

But it's years away,Lauren Sommer,"Roads and infrastructure are increasing being overwhelmed by heavier rainfall, like the California Central Valley town of Planada in January. Most states still aren't designing water systems for heavier storms. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption, Roads and infrastructure are increasing being overwhelmed by heavier rainfall, like the California Central Valley town of Planada in January. Most states still aren't designing water systems for heavier storms., Heavy storms have flooded roads and intersections across California over the last few weeks. The water often isn't coming from overflowing rivers. Instead, rainfall is simply overwhelming the infrastructure that's designed to keep people safe from flooding., A new federal law could ensure that the country's roads and infrastructure are better able to withstand increasingly destructive storms., The problem: the help won't be ready in time for the billions of dollars in infrastructure spending currently underway., As the climate gets hotter, rainfall is getting more intense in many parts of the country. But many cities aren't constructing infrastructure to handle increasing amounts of water, because the rainfall records they use to design it are decades-old in most states., Those federal records, put out by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are only sporadically updated. That means water systems are still being designed for the climate of the past., In late December, President Biden signed a bill that would require NOAA to update its extreme rainfall records for the whole country for the first time. It also requires them to forecast how climate change could make rainfall more intense in the future. NOAA is currently doing that national analysis and plans to make it available to cities and states in 2026 and 2027., Still, by then, the country will have already made the single largest investment in history in water infrastructure. The vast majority of spending from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will have been distributed, meaning most water projects will still be using old climate data., ""The past is no longer a good predictor of what's coming our way,"" says Rachel Cleetus, climate policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""We will have many, many people and billions of dollars of infrastructure at risk if we don't do better going forward."", When it comes to water infrastructure needs, Louisville, Kentucky has a long to-do list., The city's aging water system has been overwhelmed by large storms in the past, causing billions of gallons of sewage to be released into the Ohio River. The Louisville & Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District is working its way through a $2 billion dollar project list to address the problems, under an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency., To fill the funding gap, the utility is tapping into a range of federal sources, including new funds made available by the recent Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the American Rescue Plan Act., ""We don't necessarily think about the structure under our feet that needs to be ready when a storm hits, but because those climate change storms are happening more and more frequently, now is the time to invest to update those systems,"" says Stephanie Laughlin, infrastructure planning manager at Louisville MSD., Still, the utility is currently using 62 year-old rainfall records to figure out what kind of storms its stormwater system should be able to handle. It's in the process of updating to NOAA's latest rainfall records for the region, known as Atlas 14, but even those are still more than 20 years old., Extreme rainstorms have already gotten more intense in Louisville since 1961, according to a 2017 study done by the utility. The study also showed that the trend will continue, with those storms expected to drop 2-3 more inches of rain per day by 2065 as the climate gets hotter., Louisville MSD is using that climate change forecasting to help design its major water facilities, like upgrading Paddy's Run, a 70-year old pumping station on the Ohio River that protects 70,000 homes from flooding., Residents in Merced, California wade across a flooded parking lot in the recent storms. Andrew Innerarity/California Department of Water Resources hide caption, Residents in Merced, California wade across a flooded parking lot in the recent storms., But new investment in the rest of the water system, including the stormwater drains, will continue to use the older rainfall records without climate change projections. Laughlin says to change that, the utility needs new official rainfall data from NOAA., ""It needs to be at the agency level for us to put into our design guidelines,"" she says. ""That's the next step that will provide that added resilience."", Water utilities around the country are facing the same challenge. Those that have found resources, like Harris County in Texas, have funded studies to find out what kind of storms are coming their way in the coming decades. Smaller utilities are struggling to find those localized forecasts., NOAA is now set to provide a national update, after President Biden signed the FLOODS Act in December, and it will be required to revise its rainfall data and projections every 10 years. Previously, states had to pay the agency for updated rainfall records. As a result, many states are using 20-year old reports, while the Pacific Northwest only has data from the 1970s., With new funding, NOAA will also include projections of how climate change could increase precipitation across the country. A hotter atmosphere is able to hold more water vapor, driving more intense rainfall from storms., ""To have those future projections becomes very important, because the stuff that we're designing today, whether it be infrastructure or buildings, they're going to be with us for decades if not over a century, so we need to know what that future condition is to minimize damage and loss,"" says says Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers., Given the complexity of adding climate change to their analysis, NOAA officials say the earliest the update can be ready is 2026., ""We're looking for those opportunities to accelerate, but we want to make sure the data and the products are of high quality,"" says Fernando Salas, director of the Geo-Intelligence Division NOAA's Office of Water Prediction., Most states are still using outdated rainfall records to design their stormwater infrastructure. In a hotter climate, storms are dropping more intense rainfall. Kenneth James/California Department of Water Resources hide caption, Most states are still using outdated rainfall records to design their stormwater infrastructure. In a hotter climate, storms are dropping more intense rainfall., By then, the federal Environmental Protection Agency will have distributed the majority of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding. The agency began giving states $11.7 billion dollars through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund last year, which is expected to be fully delivered by 2026., ""We strongly encourage that these investments should foster resilience to all threats and hazards, both natural and man-made, that they need to support climate adaptation in the water sector,"" says Radhika Fox, assistant administrator of water at the EPA., In absence of new federal rainfall data, it will largely be up to cities and states to find ways to plan for climate change. A newly released map from the Department of Defense and NOAA, while not the official records, does show how precipitation will change across the U.S. Climate experts say without building in some leeway to handle bigger storms, communities risk building infrastructure that will be inadequate and need expensive updating far sooner than planned for., ""It's been a long time coming and better late than never,"" Cleetus says. ""But what we need to do is make sure that we're mainstreaming it into all our infrastructure decisions from here on out. Otherwise we'll be putting good money after bad.""",Climate
https://www.npr.org/2023/01/13/1148970485/morning-news-brief,2023-01-13,Morning news brief,"Dwane Brown, Leila Fadel","For the second time in two months, Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed a special counsel to investigate a politically sensitive subject. This time the special counsel is former prosecutor Robert Hur. His job is to find out how classified documents came to be located at President Joe Biden's home in Delaware and at an office tied to him in Washington. NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following the story, and she joins us now. Good morning, Carrie. Good morning. So what do we know about the mandate of this new prosecutor? The DOJ wants him to investigate the possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records found at two sites connected to President Biden. That's his home in Delaware and an office he used at a think tank in Washington, D.C., after he served as vice president. Now, of course, classified materials are supposed to be stored in special places, not out in the open or even in a locked room or a closet. The White House says Biden isn't sure what's in these papers that his lawyers found, and he didn't know the papers were there. A White House lawyer says these documents were misplaced, that this was a mistake, not intentional. But that's going to be for the Justice Department to decide. The special prosecutor is going to get to work in the coming days, and, Leila, he's already pretty familiar with how the DOJ operates. Robert Hur was a top official there in the Trump years. He also served as the U.S. attorney in Maryland in that era. Now, Attorney General Merrick Garland came into office pledging to restore public confidence in the Justice Department. Is that why he made this appointment? Merrick Garland said these regulations at the Justice Department called for him to appoint an outsider here because these are extraordinary circumstances. Here's more of what the attorney general said to explain his decision. This appointment underscores for the public the department's commitment to both independence and accountability and particularly sensitive matters and to making decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law. And Garland had praise for lawyers and agents who've already been working on this matter. He says he's going to make sure the new prosecutor has all the resources he needs to do this job. Now, this week, Republicans in Congress opened a separate investigation into President Biden and his family. How are they reacting to this appointment? I mean, he is, as you said, a top official that was there in the Trump years. Yeah. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says there's still a role for Congress to play in investigating these Biden documents. And the new chairman of the House Oversight Panel, James Comer of Kentucky, agrees. But Comer says he's really not a fan of special counsels. Here's what he said. When that special counsel is appointed, it limits our ability to do some of the oversight investigations that we want to do with respect to this. I think the House Oversight Committee can be a lot more effective and a lot quicker in getting to the truth of what really went on with those classified documents than a special counsel. Well, we have a special counsel now, and Comer says he's going to push for answers still about why the Biden administration kept this all secret from the public for months and who had access to Biden's office and his home. On the Senate side, the Intelligence Committee says they want a briefing, too, not just about these Biden papers but also about what the FBI found in its search of former President Donald Trump's home in Florida, Mar-a-Lago. That Trump investigation is much more advanced, of course. Special Counsel Jack Smith is leading that probe. He's been on the job since last November. We know some former Trump White House aides have answered questions, but there's been no public action there in that case just yet. NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson. Thanks, Carrie. Happy to be here. Ukraine is once again getting weapons that were previously off-limits. Yeah, the U.S., Germany and France have all pledged to send Western-designed armored personnel vehicles to the country. Until recently, Ukraine's allies had resisted sending them, fearing it would provoke Moscow. To understand what's behind the shift, we're going to turn to NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris. Good morning, Eleanor. Good morning, Leila. So what kind of vehicles are these? Why are they so important? Well, these are armored fighting vehicles, and they can carry infantry. The French AMX 10 CR (ph), which French President Emmanuel Macron has called a light battle tank. America's giving the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. And Germany is giving its Marders. These are armored vehicles with powerful guns, and they're meant to go on the offensive and hold ground. They were all designed during the Cold War to fight Soviet forces, ironically, though, until now, they've only been used in Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa. Kyiv has been asking for them for a while, and the West has been reluctant to send such powerful offensive weapons. So what's changed? The war has changed. The Ukrainians have shown they can not only defend their country, but many think they can win this war against an army that before the conflict was thought to be the world's second-most powerful. And this has changed the calculation. So while the West for a long time was concerned with escalating the conflict, antagonizing Russia, it's become worried about the war dragging on for years with the two sides in a seeming stalemate and no peace negotiations in sight. I spoke with Leonid Polyakov in Kyiv. He's a former deputy defense minister of Ukraine. And here's what he told me. Major powers supporting Ukraine could have decided that it is in their interest to allow Ukraine to move faster because the longer war goes, the more weapons will be required. Time is a factor now, not only unpredictability of Russia. As for Ukraine's Western allies, they have little by little increased the caliber of the weapons they're sending. Germany was at first very hesitant to send offensive weapons because of its past. You know, the Nazis killed millions of Soviet soldiers and civilians in World War II. Yeah. But it's become the biggest European contributor of weapons and aid to Ukraine now. Here's Ulrike Franke, a security specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations. This is what Germany has been doing since the 24 of February, right? Every other week or so, there is another decision to kind of go further than what they claimed they wanted to do. So how is Ukraine reacting to this weaponry upgrade? I mean, Leila, they're obviously very happy. Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said sending them had broken a taboo on providing key weapons to Ukraine. He said he hoped that the floodgates had been opened now for the West to send what are known as main battle tanks, like the U.S. Abrams tank, Germany's Leopard 2 and France's Leclerc. Analysts say those tanks would help the Ukrainians to break through Russian fortifications and artillery fire with infantry in a counteroffensive. And they might not be far behind because Poland has already said it wants to send Leopard 2s, though it has to get permission from Germany, who owns the technology. Britain is said to be heavily considering sending the Challenger 2 tank. And it's possible such heavy tanks for Ukraine could be announced as early as next week at a contact group meeting for allies of Ukraine. NPR's Paris correspondent Eleanor Beardsley. Thanks, Eleanor. Thank you. Californians have been navigating flooded roads and intersections after weeks of heavy rain. All that concrete isn't prepared for storms that are getting more extreme with climate change. A new law passed by Congress in December could change that. But the big question is, how soon will it make a difference? Lauren Sommer from NPR's Climate Desk joins us this morning. Hi there. Of course, we need the rain due to the drought, but why are we seeing so much flooding in California? Because it's not just next to rivers, right? Yeah, that's right. You know, this is flooding that often happens far from rivers. It's inside cities and neighborhoods. And it happens because a lot of rain falls, and the stormwater infrastructure, you know, which is those drains and pipes that go underground... Right. ...It simply can't handle it. You know, sometimes they get clogged, but other times they're just not designed for that much water. Why aren't they designed to handle these types of storms and water? That's because in most places, the infrastructure is based on really old rainfall records. I spoke to one utility in Kentucky, the Louisville and Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District, and their stormwater infrastructure is based on rainfall data from 1961. The problem is that storms are getting more intense. The utility did a study that found extreme rainstorms have already gotten worse and, with climate change, will drop two to three more inches of rain by 2065. Infrastructure planning manager Stephanie Laughlin says they're feeling those effects. Because those climate change storms are happening more frequently, now is the time to invest in updating those systems that were installed a hundred years ago. Yeah, Lauren, it makes sense, right? Why don't these utilities switch to more recent rainfall records or design better infrastructure? Yeah, I mean, some big utilities are doing that. But in general, the problem is that they rely on the official rainfall data from the federal government. That's put out by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In late December, though, President Biden signed a law that requires NOAA to update these records for the entire country and to include climate change forecasts about future storms. And NOAA is already working on that update. Right. Infrastructure, a big focus right now with a bipartisan infrastructure law rolling out, talking billions of dollars being spent - will that update, do you think, be ready in time for this? Yeah, the problem is that NOAA won't have that new climate rainfall data until 2026. The vast majority of the infrastructure funding, which is almost $12 billion for these water systems, will be distributed by then. NOAA officials say it will take that long because doing this analysis for the whole country is pretty complex. Yeah, so what should cities and states do in the meantime if they're planning some big water projects? Yeah. Yeah, that's the key question because what's built today will last 50, 60 years, even longer. I spoke to Rachel Cleetus, who works on extreme weather policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, and she said even without this updated rainfall info, cities need to build in some kind of margin of safety to deal with climate change. What we need to do is make sure that we're mainstreaming it into all of our infrastructure decisions from here on out. Otherwise, we'd be putting good money after bad. We will have roads and bridges that might get washed out. We might have power infrastructure that's vulnerable. What needs to happen, she says, is a real shift in how we build things. You know, infrastructure that's around us is based on the idea that the future is just like the past, and that's not true anymore. And many cities are struggling to make that shift. That's Lauren Sommer from NPR's Climate Desk. Thanks, Lauren. Thank you. ",Law

Mohamed Sadek for NPR hide caption, Sarah Slack, an eighth grade science teacher at J.H.S. 223 The Montauk in Brooklyn, explains to her students how to collect temperature data on their school playground., ""Take a look over your data sheet and make sure you know what all the words mean,"" Sarah Slack tells her class of eighth graders. The students stop talking to each other and turn toward their science teacher, who is standing in front of a digital blackboard holding up a sample data sheet. ""We're going to be not only collecting temperatures in the sun and in the shade, but you're going to choose some words to describe the weather."", Slack's students do a lot of hands-on science. Inside their Brooklyn, N.Y. junior high school, J.H.S. 223, she's built a lab that is a small ecosystem itself. On one end of the room hydroponic gardens spritz water over patches of arugula, kale, cucumbers, peppers, and tomatoes, the grow lights casting a bright white glow across the room. In a back corner, tiny baby trout swim in a bubbling aquarium, the filter humming quietly. And on Slack's desk common mollies, another small fish, dart around a tank with basil growing out of the top. Each nourishes the other in a symbiotic cycle., But on this early November day, the school playground will serve as the students' lab. ""I think we're ready, everybody,"" Slack says, opening the classroom door. ""You're going to need to bring three things with you – something to write with, your notebook, and you're going to need an infrared surface thermometer."", The students surround a milk crate at the center of the room to grab handheld thermometers, which they quickly begin testing on everything around them – the desks, the chairs, and their bodies – before following their teacher out the door., Slack's students use handheld digital thermometers to measure temperatures around their school playground. Mohamed Sadek for NPR hide caption, Slack's students use handheld digital thermometers to measure temperatures around their school playground., While this temperature-taking lesson will provide basic practice in data collection, Slack has a much bigger lesson in mind., She'll upload the measurements these students collect from playground surfaces to a database made available to climate scientists through NASA. Slack aims to help her eighth graders understand climate change, and also how to use science to mitigate the tangible impacts of the warming world. Especially right here, in at their school and in their neighborhood., Slack reminds them what surface temperatures they'll be investigating. ""We're measuring pavement, concrete, dirt, and grass. Which one of these is going to be the hardest to find out there?"" she asks., It's an easy question. ""Grass,"" several students mutter at once., The playground they're heading toward is similar to many in New York and other urban areas. It's made of – and surrounded by – asphalt and concrete, materials that heat up quickly but cool off slowly., To get there, the students have to go through a tunnel of metal construction scaffolding that surrounds their school. Some run and skip; others amble slowly, gossiping with friends. They all spill out onto a wide open blacktop. The only plant life here is a handful of spindly trees, leaves brown and falling, spaced out along the playground's perimeter in small dirt plots., Students split up to take surface temperatures of different materials in the yard. Most scurry around the asphalt pavement, pointing their thermometers toward the ground. Others start collecting temperature data from the small dirt patches under the trees, trying to find both sunny and shady spots to measure. A handful of students head for a bright, colorful mural painted on a concrete wall that serves as one of the borders of the playground., The temperature data these eighth graders are collecting from various spots around their school playground will be uploaded to a NASA database for climate scientists to use. Mohamed Sadek for NPR hide caption, The temperature data these eighth graders are collecting from various spots around their school playground will be uploaded to a NASA database for climate scientists to use., One eighth grader, Li Qing, wearing pastel pink sweats and puffy lavender jacket, points her handheld thermometer at part of the large mural. ""It's technically hotter than the dirt,"" she notes. ""I guess the cement absorbs more heat, or something,"" she thinks out loud., She points her thermometer at a flower painted in the mural., ""The white one is only 70 degrees,"" she says, before pivoting to a part of the mural inches away, showing a black bicycle tire., ""Oh my God. 89!"" she says., In short order, most students had measured and recorded temperatures of three of the four surfaces Slack asked them to measure., Just one left to find. Grass., This hard surface playground is tucked between the four-story brick school building on one side and the concrete wall of a New York townhouse – with the mural – on another. Two tall chain link fences edge the rest of the playground. Through the metal links, blacktop streets lined with brick houses stretch as far as the eye can see., City data ranks this neighborhood, Borough Park, high on its ""heat vulnerability"" index, which shows the relative impact of extreme heat events, such as deaths, on different communities. Surface temperatures are one big indicator of risk, and as Slack's students discover, the materials surrounding their school – asphalt and concrete – get hot., When scientists look at a bunch of neighborhoods like Borough Park together, they see what's called an ""urban heat island"" – places where urban centers are significantly warmer than their suburban and rural neighbors. Within cities, different neighborhoods, blocks, and even buildings can have different surface temperatures., Historic inequity plays a significant role: neighborhoods that have long been low-income and majority people of color often lack parks, lush green lawns, and trees that can help cool off a neighborhood., ""Formerly redlined neighborhoods are also those that tend to have fewer trees, and also more heat so that those patterns all connect to environmental justice issues,"" Slack says., Borough Park has a long immigrant history and high rates of poverty and renters compared to the average in New York City. The two parks nearest J.H.S 223 are both a five minute walk from the school. Although they provide some shade and greenery, they are also part of the urban infrastructure, with leafy trees tucked around paved play areas. One park is right next to an elevated train line., Science teacher Sarah Slack wants her students to build scientific skills and collect data that could be used to advocate for changes to help cool down their own urban neighborhood. Mohamed Sadek for NPR hide caption, Science teacher Sarah Slack wants her students to build scientific skills and collect data that could be used to advocate for changes to help cool down their own urban neighborhood., Slack hopes that teaching her students to think like scientists can be a catalyst for change right in this neighborhood., ""If we had more trees or more grass around us in Brooklyn, then people walking to the store on a hot day would be more protected from those hot temperatures,"" Slack says. ""I think the most important thing that would come out of doing this kind of work is for students to realize that they don't have to fix climate change, but they have the ability to make things better in their own communities."", The data from their school yard might contribute to doing both., The official temperature for Borough Park the fall day Slack's students did this outdoor lab was an unseasonably warm 68 degrees. Around the playground, students clocked temperatures lower and much higher than that., ""53 point 6,"" one student reported to Slack, measuring the pavement in the shade of the school building., ""Hold up, I got 79,"" another student told her group of friends as they stood in a circle in the sun comparing readings. ""I got 81,"" one of her friends responded, pointing her thermometer toward her feet on the hot asphalt., One patch of the playground asphalt pavement isn't black. It's has a grid of six circles, each a different color of the rainbow. Two years ago, Slack and her students painted this, as a way to test what a completely different schoolyard might feel like – a playground that was yellow, or blue, or purple instead of black. ""We measure the temperature there to see what would happen if we painted the whole yard a color,"" Slack says., Students log heat measurements, then calculate the average temperature of asphalt, concrete, dirt, and grass, in both sunlight and shade. Mohamed Sadek for NPR hide caption, Students log heat measurements, then calculate the average temperature of asphalt, concrete, dirt, and grass, in both sunlight and shade., The circles are faded from two years of sun, sneakers, and bouncing balls. But they're still cooler than the surrounding blacktop., ""Purple was the hottest years ago, but it's so faded now I didn't know if it would still be the hottest one,"" Slack says, reviewing one student's data sheet – which showed that even faded, the purple circle still absorbs the most heat., Later, students will punch numbers from their scribbled sheets into calculators to determine average temperatures for different surfaces. Slack combines data from all her classes and adds it to a national collection via a NASA app called GLOBE., Climate scientists have used a mixture of satellite measurements and on-the-ground temperature recordings to document urban heat islands. While satellites are much more convenient, since they can capture the temperature of a large area very quickly, they do not entirely reflect what people feel on the street., ""We have to remember that [a satellite is] going to pick up what it hits first,"" says Jennifer Vanos, a climate scientist at Arizona State University who studies extreme heat and schools. ""So the top of the tree, the top of the building, the top of some shade canopy, which means it's not going to get what's kind of under that which is valuable information we do miss and if we're thinking about what's at the level of where human is, we might miss some of that surface temperature information."", Things like the construction scaffolding circling much of J.H.S. 223 and the awnings of nearby bodegas would block satellites from collecting street-level temperatures around the school and neighborhood., After measuring heat levels around their playground, science students at Brooklyn's J.H.S 223, including Fatiha Khan, seen here, calculate the overall average temperatures of four types of surfaces. Mohamed Sadek for NPR hide caption, After measuring heat levels around their playground, science students at Brooklyn's J.H.S 223, including Fatiha Khan, seen here, calculate the overall average temperatures of four types of surfaces., Satellites also average temperature data over 30 square meter chunks, which is helpful in studying larger trends between neighborhoods but leaves out a lot of detail, such as how hot one building is compared to another., University of Toledo geographer Kevin Czajkowski is helping NASA coordinate projects like Slack's with schools across the country., Czajkowski says that efforts to study the urban heat island effect have picked up in the past several years. ""GLOBE is facilitating studying the urban heat island. I think that's helped,"" he says., In addition, this street-level data alongside the satellite readings could help local governments decide where to plant trees, set up cooling centers, or make future schools and playgrounds more resilient to heat – and safer for kids., Even within a dense city like New York, schools can stick out as hotspots if they lack shade or plants., ""If a school yard is dark asphalt and rubber or artificial turf, or concrete and there's not much shade or vegetation, then yes, you will end up seeing that those pop out on urban [heat] maps,"" says Vanos., She also says heat trapped and amplified by schools and playgrounds can become dangerous for kids., Two students measure the temperature of a metal shipping container in the parking lot of their school (L). A thermal camera image (R) of them at work suggests they'll find differences even up and down the container wall. Mohamed Sadek for NPR hide caption, ""If they are starting to experience the signs of heat illness, a lot of times kids may not notice that and just kind of keep playing,"" she says. ""We want them to play and that's the goal of playgrounds for sure, but we want to make sure that the environments that they're provided to play are conducive to play even when it's hot out."", NASA coordinator Czajkowski knows from experience how detrimental hot playgrounds can be to children. His youngest son came home one day suffering from heat illness after playing outside at school. ""He was really sick,"" Czajkowski says, As Slack's students wrap up collecting the temperatures of asphalt, concrete, and dirt, many flock to her. ""Where is the grass?"" they ask. Slack points them outside the playground, through the gate of a chain link fence, across the school parking lot, and out onto the sidewalk., The young scientists crowd around a few meager patches of green rooted under a couple of trees in the street strip. They try to aim their thermometers to catch the temperature of the sparse blades., The grass appears cooler than on the blacktop. ""67, 69.9,"" one student called out numbers from his thermometer to others gathered around the tree., Students outside Brooklyn's J.H.S. 223 try to measure the surface temperature of dirt and single blades of grass. Schools can become hotspots if, like this one, they have lots of asphalt and little vegetation. Mohamed Sadek for NPR hide caption, Students outside Brooklyn's J.H.S. 223 try to measure the surface temperature of dirt and single blades of grass. Schools can become hotspots if, like this one, they have lots of asphalt and little vegetation., But because this patch of green is so tiny, surrounded by a sea of heat-absorbing city, it can't help cool the area much. ""Just because those two surface temperatures are different does not mean that the air temperature above them is different necessarily,"" Vanos, the climate scientist says. ""When you start to have large areas of asphalt, or large parks, then you can start to see an influence on air temperature."", Slack hopes this lesson will empower her students to imagine a completely different type of playground, dominated by plants, trees and natural surfaces, that could serve as a safer place to play amid rising temperatures, and help cool off the surrounding neighborhood., ""I understand all the challenges of having plants in an area where 200 middle school students go outside for recess,"" Slack says. ""But I see the overwhelming value of providing them with a space that's going to be cooler, and that's going to help make their entire neighborhood cooler."", Slack hopes this lesson will inspire her middle school students to advocate for improvements to their outdoor environment, at school and in their wider community. Mohamed Sadek for NPR hide caption, Slack hopes this lesson will inspire her middle school students to advocate for improvements to their outdoor environment, at school and in their wider community., Over the next year, Slack hopes to train other teachers in New York schools to do the same sorts of data collection she does with her students, both to add to global warming data and to help paint a picture of temperatures at schools across the city., But most immediately, she hopes that students in this school walk away from her class inspired to help their own community., ""My students are a population that need to hear and understand that they're going to have to talk louder and wave their arms around more to get the attention that their community needs more than many other communities in the city,"" Slack says., NPR's Lauren Migaki contributed reporting.",Education

The UAE is a major oil producer, but it's also a place battling extreme heat. Today it upset environmentalists by appointing the head of the country's main state oil company to lead the negotiations at COP 28. NPR's Aya Batrawy reports from Dubai. Environmental activist group Greenpeace says it's deeply alarmed by the UAE's appointment of Sultan al-Jaber to lead this November's global climate conference. Other environmentalists called it a breathtaking conflict of interest and a slap in the face to those suffering from manmade climate disasters. Al-Jaber is head of Abu Dhabi state-owned oil firm ADNOC. But the announcement of his appointment noted at length his background overseeing clean energy projects and his past experience as the UAE's climate change envoy. He's also helping funnel billions of dollars in government investments in carbon capture technologies and energy efficiency projects.But oil is key to the UAE's economy, allowing its unelected leadership to provide citizens with massive perks, develop the country and expand influence abroad. And Gulf Arab states argue the world still runs on fossil fuels, energy sources that billions of people rely on for their existence. Here's how al-Jaber himself put it last year at an energy forum in Dubai.- We cannot and must not unplug the current energy system before we have built the new one. He says even the U.S. and Europe are acknowledging this.AL- Transitions, by definition, take time. And this one will take time. But scientists caution countries need to cut carbon emissions now to slow global warming. The International Energy Agency says there should be no new investments in coal plants or oil and gas. Instead, they've called for a massive deployment in clean energy technologies. Al-Jaber disagrees. Here he is again in remarks last year.AL- Let's create a clear roadmap that is based on real and solid foundations. Let's adopt policies that strengthen the stability of energy markets. Let's continue to invest in new and future energies. But let's not defund the current energy system. While the UAE needs oil, there's also a realization here that the long summers are getting even hotter. It's so dangerous to work outside midday during some months that the government has outlawed it. Aya Batrawy, NPR News, Dubai.(, """") ",Climate

Still it sowed doubt,Jeff Brady,"Climate activists protest on the first day of the ExxonMobil trial outside the New York State Supreme Court building on Oct. 22, 2019, in New York City. ExxonMobil was found not guilty of misleading investors about how climate change would affect its finances. Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, Climate activists protest on the first day of the ExxonMobil trial outside the New York State Supreme Court building on Oct. 22, 2019, in New York City. ExxonMobil was found not guilty of misleading investors about how climate change would affect its finances., Decades of research by scientists at Exxon accurately predicted how much global warming would occur from burning fossil fuels, according to a new study in the journal Science., The findings clash with an enormously successful campaign that Exxon spearheaded and funded for more than 30 years that cast doubt on human-driven climate change and the science underpinning it. That narrative helped delay federal and international action on climate change, even as the impacts of climate change worsened., Over the last few years, journalists and researchers revealed that Exxon did in-house research that showed it knew that human-caused climate change is real. The new study looked at Exxon's research and compared it to the warming that has actually happened., Researchers at Harvard University and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research analyzed Exxon's climate studies from 1977 to 2003. The researchers show the company, now called ExxonMobil, produced climate research that was at least as accurate as work by independent academics and governments — and occasionally surpassed it., That's important because ExxonMobil and the broader fossil fuel industry face lawsuits nationwide claiming they misled the public on the harmful effects of their products., ""The bottom line is we found that they were modeling and predicting global warming with, frankly, shocking levels of skill and accuracy, especially for a company that then spent the next couple of decades denying that very climate science,"" says lead author Geoffrey Supran, who now is an associate professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami., The Earth already has warmed a little more than 1 degree Celsius (about 2 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to preindustrial times of the late 1800s. That warming has led to extreme weather in recent years, including heat waves, droughts and floods. The researchers found, for example, that Exxon's own modeling charted this kind of temperature increase., ""Specifically, what we've done is to actually put a number for the first time on what Exxon knew, which is that the burning of their fossil fuel products would heat the planet by something like 0.2 [degrees] Celsius every single decade,"" Supran says., , While ExxonMobil has not addressed the specifics in this paper, the company did respond before the research was published., ""This issue has come up several times in recent years and, in each case, our answer is the same: those who talk about how 'Exxon Knew' are wrong in their conclusions,"" wrote ExxonMobil spokesman Todd Spitler in a statement., The campaign to reveal what ExxonMobil knew and when has coalesced on social media under the hashtag #ExxonKnew., ""ExxonMobil's understanding of climate science has developed along with that of the broader scientific community,"" said Spitler. He said ""well intended, internal policy debates"" have been recast by some ""as an attempted company disinformation campaign."", Spitler pointed to a related 2019 case ExxonMobil won in New York and specifically highlighted a section on Page 37 of the 55-page ruling, in which Justice Barry Ostrager of the New York State Supreme Court wrote:, ""What the evidence at trial revealed is that ExxonMobil executives and employees were uniformly committed to rigorously discharging their duties in the most comprehensive and meticulous manner possible. ... The testimony of these witnesses demonstrated that ExxonMobil has a culture of disciplined analysis, planning, accounting, and reporting."", In that case, the New York Attorney General's Office failed to show that the company broke state law and deceived investors by allegedly downplaying the effects climate change would have on ExxonMobil's finances., As NPR reported at the time, Ostrager also wrote, ""Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve ExxonMobil from responsibility for contributing to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gasses in the production of its fossil fuel products."" And Ostranger added, ""this is a securities fraud case, not a climate change case."", ExxonMobil has a lot at stake in arguing that it did not mislead investors or the public about what it knew about the climate-warming effects of fossil fuels, and when., The company faces more than 20 lawsuits brought by states and local governments for damages caused by climate change. Baltimore was among the first. And last year, cities in Puerto Rico filed a racketeering lawsuit against fossil fuel companies, industry groups and others claiming they conspired to mislead the public about climate change., This new research could provide more evidence for those cases as they progress through the courts, says Karen Sokol, a law professor at Loyola University in New Orleans., ""What Exxon scientists found and what they communicated to company executives was nothing short of horrifying,"" says Sokol. Given how science works, she says that should have prompted the company to raise an alarm to the public and policymakers., ""Imagine that world and the different trajectory that consumers, investors and policymakers would have taken when we still had time, versus now when we're entrenched in a fossil fuel-based economy that's getting increasingly expensive and difficult to exit,"" says Sokol., She says that provides ""significant evidence"" of the kind of deception and law-breaking that many of the lawsuits are based on., ExxonMobil and the broader fossil fuel industry have sought to stop lawsuits by getting states to pass laws to block municipalities from suing, according to the watchdog group Center for Climate Integrity., The industry also has tried to move the cases to potentially friendlier federal courts, arguing they're of national significance. In August the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia declined to do that for a 2020 case brought by the state of Delaware and city of Hoboken, N.J. Delaware sought compensation for lost property value because of climate-induced sea level rise and flooding. Hoboken wants money to pay for current and future costs., As the largest U.S. oil company, ExxonMobil often faces more scrutiny from activists. The company now says it's ""committed to being part of the solution to climate change and the risks it poses."" Climate activists are skeptical, but one thing is clear: Questions over the company's history of stalling climate action will be the subject of legal battles for years.",Climate

Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber speaks at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition & Conference in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Oct. 31, 2022. Kamran Jebreili/AP hide caption, The Emirati Minister of State and the CEO of Abu Dhabi's state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber speaks at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition & Conference in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Oct. 31, 2022., DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The United Arab Emirates on Thursday named a veteran technocrat who both leads Abu Dhabi's state-run oil company and oversees its renewable energy efforts to be the president of the upcoming United Nations climate negotiations in Dubai, highlighting the balancing act ahead for this crude-producing nation., Authorities nominated Sultan al-Jaber, a trusted confidant of UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who serves as CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. That firm pumps some 4 million barrels of crude a day and hopes to expand to 5 million daily., Those revenues fuel the ambitions of this federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula — as well as the production of more of the heat-trapping carbon dioxide that the U.N. negotiations hope to limit., But al-Jaber also once led a once-ambitious project to have a $22 billion ""carbon-neutral"" city on Abu Dhabi's outskirts — an effort later pared back after the global financial crisis that struck the Emirates hard beginning in 2008. Even today, he serves as the chairman of Masdar, a clean energy company that grew out of the project., ""Sultan al-Jaber has the credentials and background to lean into trends that are already on going,"" said Ryan Bohl, a Mideast analyst for a risk-intelligence firm called the RANE Network. ""Him being an oilman, I don't think that will be that big of a risk for him."", The Emirates' state-run WAM quoted al-Jaber, a climate envoy for years, as saying that it ""will be a critical year in a critical decade for climate action."" He called for ""a pragmatic, realistic and solutions-oriented approach"" to limit global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2050. Scientists say that limit can avoid or at least lessen some of the most catastrophic future climate change harms., Al-Jaber's nomination, however, drew immediate criticism. Harjeet Singh, who is the head of Global Political Strategy at Climate Action Network International, said al-Jaber holding the CEO title at the state oil company posed ""an unprecedented and alarming conflict of interest."", ""There can be no place for polluters at a climate conference, least of all presiding over a COP,"" Singh said., Alice Harrison of Global Witness put it even more bluntly: ""You wouldn't invite arms dealers to lead peace talks. So why let oil executives lead climate talks?"" Greenpeace said it was ""deeply alarmed"" by al-Jaber's appointment, adding: ""This sets a dangerous precedent, risking the credibility of the UAE and the trust that has been placed in them."", Each year, the country hosting the U.N. negotiations known as the Conference of the Parties — where COP gets its name — nominates a person to chair the talks. Hosts typically pick a veteran diplomat as the talks can be incredibly difficult to steer between competing nations and their interests. The nominee's position as ""COP president"" is confirmed by delegates at the start of the talks, usually without objections., The caliber of COP presidents has varied over the years. Observers widely saw Britain's Alok Sharma as energetic and committed to achieving an ambitious result., Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, on the other hand, faced criticism by some for the chaotic and at times non-transparent way he presided over last year's meeting., A call by countries, including India and the United States, for a phase down of oil and natural gas, for instance, never reached a public discussion during the meeting in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh where Shoukry controlled the agenda., Activists worry that COP being held in a Mideast nation reliant on fossil fuel sales for a second year in a row could see something similar happen in the Emirates., WAM said the Emirates had invested ""more than $50 billion in renewable energy projects across 70 countries, with plans to invest a minimum of $50 billion over the next decade."" It wasn't immediately clear where those figures came from., Mubadala, Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, has invested some $3.9 billion since 2018 in renewable energy, according to the New York-based research firm Global SWF. Masdar listed having $14.3 billion in investments in 2020. Masdar did not respond to questions about its investments Thursday., By comparison, Mubadala invested $9.8 billion over the same period in oil and gas projects, Global SWF said., The UAE is home to a massive solar park in Dubai, as well as the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, which is the Arabian Peninsula's only atomic energy source. But it also requires vast amounts of energy to run the desalination plants that brought green golf courses to its desert expanses, power the air conditioners cooling its cavernous malls in the heat of the summer and power heavy industries like aluminum smelters., The UAE's clean energy policies grew in the mid-2000s as Dubai's real-estate boom saw it constructing the world's tallest building and massive, palm-shaped archipelagos off its coast. The World Wildlife Fund at the time estimated the UAE had the world's largest ecological footprint per capita — meaning that each of its residents used more resources on average than those living in any other nation. The UAE still ranks high on similar lists., The Masdar City project grew out of that concern of being tarnished, before being pared back., ""By us actually doing it and investing money, we had access to lessons learned that no one had access to,"" al-Jaber told The Associated Press in 2010. ""We have to learn, adjust, adapt and move forward. We can't be rigid."", The UAE then pivoted Masdar City into a campus now hosting the U.N.'s International Renewable Energy Agency and the firm itself into investing into renewables at home and abroad. Joe Biden, just before leaving office as America's vice president, even visited Masdar City in 2016., Analysts believe the Emirates is trying to maximize its profits before the world increasingly turns to renewables. The Emirates itself has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2050 — a target that remains difficult to assess and one that authorities haven't fully explained how they'll reach., The UAE ""have made no bones about being a major oil and gas producer and presumably he is very well connected to rulers in the country,"" said Alden Meyer, a longtime climate talk observer at the environmental think tank E3G.

NPR's Nathan Rott has more. One hundred sixty-five billion dollars - that's how much damage weather-related disasters did in the U.S. in 2022, not to mention the loss of life - at least 474 people, according to the new report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Rick Spinrad is NOAA's administrator. Climate change is creating more and more intense extreme events that cause significant damage and often sets off cascading hazards, like intense drought, followed by devastating wildfires, followed by dangerous flooding and mudslides as we're seeing, for example, as a consequence of the atmospheric rivers in California right now. Climate change is a major driver of the recent uptick in so-called billion-dollar disasters, which often cost far more. Hurricane Ian, for example, which walloped South Florida and the Caribbean, caused nearly $113 billion in damage in the U.S. alone. But the other major issue contributing to that cost is how we build and where. People are still moving to flood-prone areas, to fire-prone areas, to the drought-stricken West. Rachel Cleetus is a policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. At this point, we're still far too often reacting to these as one-off disasters. And the reality is climate change is worsening the trend here. And we have to do much better at getting out ahead and protecting and preparing communities in advance of disasters. Particularly, she says, low-income communities and communities of color, which are disproportionately impacted by natural disasters. European climate researchers confirmed that the last eight years had been the warmest in modern world history. And perhaps most concerning, the cause of climate change, greenhouse gases from human activities, are still rising. The nonpartisan research firm Rhodium Group put out a report showing that despite the Biden administration's pledges and the massive climate bill passed by Congress last year, U.S. emissions rose again in 2022, risking even worse climate change in the future.Nathan Rott, NPR News.

Sean Gallup/Getty Images hide caption, The British government is set to announce the full details of the single-use plastics ban on Saturday., The British government is poised to ban certain single-use plastic products, a long-awaited step towards reducing pollution that environmentalists hope will be just one of many., The ban will cover plastic plates, trays, bowls, cutlery, balloon sticks and certain kinds of polystyrene cups and food containers, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told The Mail on Sunday., A department spokesperson confirmed to NPR that the full announcement is coming on Saturday., ""A plastic fork can take 200 years to decompose — that is two centuries in landfill or polluting our oceans,"" Environment Secretary Therese Coffey told The Mail. ""This new ban will have a huge impact to stop the pollution of billions of pieces of plastic and help to protect the natural environment for future generations."", England banned single-use plastic straws, stirrers and plastic-stemmed cotton buds in 2020., This new ban applies specifically to plastic packaging of food and drinks from restaurants and cafes, not in supermarkets and stores. The government plans to address those in a separate scheme that would have manufacturers cover disposal costs starting in 2024., And it doesn't come as a complete surprise. Environmentalists have long campaigned for this kind of ban in England — Scotland's took effect last summer and Wales approved one in December — and the British government had been soliciting public input on potential plastic bans for some time. Officials indicated last month that restrictions were on the horizon., (Meanwhile, in the U.S.: Several states and localities have banned certain plastic products, namely bags, and California set the country's strictest rules for plastic reduction in legislation passed last summer. The federal government is planning to phase out single-use plastics at national parks by 2032)., Environmental advocates are applauding England's ban as an important step towards tackling the pervasive problem of plastic pollution, even if it's not enough on its own., Each person in England uses an average of 18 single-use plastic plates and 37 items of plastic cutlery every year — yet only 10% of that waste is recycled into new things, according to Defra statistics reported by the BBC. Overall, the department says, England uses 1.1 billion single-use plates and 4.3 billion single-use pieces of cutlery annually., That's both dangerous for the environment and ""completely unnecessary,"" says Steve Hyndside, the policy manager at British nonprofit City to Sea., He stressed in a Monday interview with radio station LBC that all of the items covered by this ban already have potential replacements on the market, whether that's cardboard boxes, wooden utensils or even one's fingers., ""What we're talking about here is, I think, a really positive vision,"" Hyndside said. ""So as much as we all like the convenience of single-use plastic, and I think there's no point pretending that's not there ... we just can't carry on going as we are."", England's 25 Year Environment Plan — established in 2018 — calls for eliminating avoidable plastic waste by 2042., Defra said in Nov. 2021 that while it had already proposed and enacted measures to work towards that goal, those measures did not sufficiently address the issue of single-use plastic items. It sought public input on potential bans in a consultation period that ran through February 2022, which appears to have informed its decision., ""I am determined to drive forward action to tackle this issue head on,"" Coffey told The Mail. ""We know there is more to do, and we have again listened to the public's calls."", Greenpeace UK says the ""vast majority"" of the more than 51,000 people who self-reported their views on the consultation support a ban on all of the items up for consideration (like cutlery and plates), with support at 96% or above ""across the board."", Separately, environmental groups submitted a petition to ban those items, with more than 117,000 signatures, to the prime minister's office when the comment period closed in February., After reports of the new ban surfaced, environmental groups applauded it as an important move but one of many the government needs to take to make a meaningful difference., ""We need to wean ourselves off single-use items,"" tweeted environmental organization Keep Britain Tidy. ""[Defra's] plans to ban single-use plastic plates and cutlery in England are a step in the right direction."", Many would like to see more, and more systemic, changes., As part of their ""Cut the Cutlery"" campaign, Greenpeace, City to Sea and 38 Degrees called on the government to work faster to meet the European Union single-use plastic restrictions, which it agreed to before Brexit. They also want it to set its own legally binding targets for 2025, specifically to reduce single-use plastics by 50% and for 25% of plastic to be reusable., Advocates are also calling for a ""deposit return scheme,"" which would incentivize recycling by charging customers a deposit on beverage containers and refunding it when they return the empty container to a collection point. U.K. officials have said that such a program won't take effect in England, Wales and Northern Ireland until at least late 2024, six years after it was first announced., Megan Randles, a political campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said in a tweet that ""the removal of billions of commonly littered items is never a bad thing"" but called the new ban an overdue move and ""still a drop in the ocean compared to the action that's needed to stem the plastic tide."", ""We need system change at the source - reduction and reuse/refill targets, meaningful extended producer responsibility (so the polluters actually pay) and a deposit return scheme like so many European countries have already,"" she said., Hyndside, of City to Sea, described the partial plastics ban as ""minimum standards"" and called on the government to go further by publishing a full strategy for tackling plastic pollution as a whole., ""We have to move away from all single-use kind of throwaway items,"" he said, ""and try to encourage a more circular economy.""",Environment

At least 14 people have died in the recent storms, The Associated Press reported, citing state officials., A second deluge, on Tuesday, is predicted to mainly unload on Southern California. And Northern California will face a third batch of rain on Wednesday., Sections of coastal Highway 101 were closed on Monday, with video showing it as a ""moving river."" Tens of thousands of people living in coastal areas were ordered to evacuate., But it's not just rain that's a worry.

Parts of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties had endured more than 10 inches of rain over two days by Monday evening. A giant sinkhole closed a road down in Santa Barbara, impacting 500 homes., The weather service warned that ""yet another batch of heavy precipitation will be moving into Northern California and the coastal Pacific Northwest on Wednesday,"" but said that storm will not make its way south., Staff writer Ayana Archie contributed to this report.",Weather

Whitney Museum of American Art hide caption, Gabriella Torres-Ferrer, Untitled (Valora tu mentira americana) (detail), 2018. Hurricane-ravaged wooden electric post with statehood propaganda. Private collection; courtesy of the artist and Embajada, San Juan., One of the most striking pieces in a new exhibit of Puerto Rican artists wrestling with life after (and before) Hurricane Maria is a simple electric post, suspended in the air as if a hurricane had swooped it up, right that minute., It's a commentary on the almost complete failure of the archipelago's electric grid after the hurricane five years ago. But because attached to the pole is a sign in Spanish — ""Value your American citizenship. Vote for statehood"" — it's clear that the piece also wonders: Where is the U.S. government? Why hasn't it solved this very basic issue of electricity?, Yet, would things have been better after the hurricane if Puerto Rico were a state? Some think not., ""We can talk about how Puerto Ricans are [already] citizens. So what kind of citizenship is citizenship?"" asked Marcela Guerrero, the Jennifer Rubio Associate Curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. She moved to New York from Puerto Rico not long before the hurricane., Guerrero is the curator of the exhibit, called ""no existe un mundo poshuracán: Puerto Rican Art in the Wake of Hurricane Maria."" It means a post-hurricane world doesn't exist. And in this case a hurricane, she said, is a metaphor for a force you can't escape., Much of this exhibit is about those forces — colonialism, mismanagement at all levels of government, climate change, earthquakes, and the failure of the power grid., ""It's just — this again. And again. It's an ever-perpetuating cycle of unjust conditions imposed on the daily lives of Puerto Ricans,"" Guerrero said. ""I want people to understand that it's not just an inconvenience. It's not just you can't watch Netflix! You can't refrigerate medicines, [for example]. It makes living very hard."", There's a deep anger running through ""no existe,"" a feeling that the United States has never had Puerto Rico's best interests at heart; that maybe the storm wouldn't have been such a historic disaster if the government didn't prioritize investing in beaches instead of basic infrastructure, and if it didn't seem to care more about tourists than about the people who actually live there., ""B-roll,"" a video piece by the visual artist Sofía Gallisá Muriente, points that out by juxtaposing lush, tourist-office scenes of an island paradise with remixed field recordings from the 2016 Puerto Rico investment summit that extolled the archipelago to investors., ""I am optimistic for the long-term growth prospects for Puerto Rico,"" the video says, accompanied by electronic music composed by Daniel Montes Carro. ""It has a perfect climate. You can minimize your taxes."", ""I was really interested in, what are the images that are being produced to entice people to move or invest in Puerto Rico? And what do they say about us and how we offer ourselves to the world?"" Muriente said. ""And, you know, a lot of them are beautiful beaches with no people in them. A lot of them are, you know, beautiful landscapes kind of open for consumption, but without locals."", She said she just wanted to reveal ""how sinister"" those visual images could be. And they DO seem sinister, with men in suits looking down from helicopters at empty streets., The exhibit, though, is not all tragedy. And much of it is very personal. The 20 artists, some living in Puerto Rico and some in the diaspora, explore love, hope and pride. There are posters of resistance in eye-popping colors by Garvin Sierra, a painting of another man-made disaster by Gamaliel Rodríguez, and photographic works by Gabriella N. Báez that stitch together her late father and herself with red string., Sofía Córdova's two-hour video piece, ""dawn chorus ii: el niágara en bicicleta,"" stretches against an entire wall as visitors enter the exhibit. Ron Amstutz/Whitney Museum of American Art hide caption, Sofía Córdova's two-hour video piece, ""dawn chorus ii: el niágara en bicicleta,"" stretches against an entire wall as visitors enter the exhibit., Mixed-media artist Sofía Córdova's video piece, part of a larger work looking at resource scarcity called ""dawn chorus,"" starts with a cellphone video taken by her aunt. Rain and wind beat at the windows on the night the storm hits; the electricity is out. She narrates what she's seeing. ""It's getting worse,"" she says., The two-hour work has images of Puerto Rico post-hurricane, where you see flooded streets and broken residences. But it also shows quiet beauty: a lizard, a landscape. Through it all plays intimate interviews of Córdova's relatives, processing everything they've been through. It feels as though you are sitting around a kitchen table with them, listening to their stories. You get to know them as people who are thinking their way around a problem: what should they do now?, That's what Córdova intended., Individuals sometimes become invisible during and after a disaster — they're just seen as collective victims. But in this artist's hands, they are full people, relating their experiences with all their contradictions., ""Caribbean peoples and marginalized peoples and oppressed peoples — our histories are never the ones that get put in the great archives,"" Córdova said. ""So we witness for each other. And storytelling becomes such a foundational piece of struggle and survival."", ""no existe un mundo poshuracán: Puerto Rican Art in the Wake of Hurricane Maria"" runs through April 2023 at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.",Culture

From member station KQED, Danielle Venton reports on how people who live in flood-prone areas are preparing. Rain falls on Kristen Thurman's home, right on the banks of the Russian River in the town of Monte Rio. Please come on in. Flood prep for her is about having food on hand and getting organized. We right now are in the process of being prepared to do a quick emptying of that basement if we see, indeed, that it's going to come. This means getting things up. She and her husband Dan are pros at this by now. They've lived in this house for 40 years. For those of us who've been through it a long time, it's just a tedious, stressful, tiresome but incredibly awesome experience just watching the river. They were in this house during the worst flood on record here in Sonoma County. The year was 1986. And the water came up to one level and then stayed there for about a week. And then storms hit, and it just came up so fast. It was incredible. And it was about three feet in this house. We stayed on the second floor for about four days - and just stayed there. Kristen's husband Dan would pull on waders and go downstairs to get cans of food from the kitchen. One storm hit after another, similar to the chain of atmospheric rivers now stacked up out in the Pacific Ocean and heading toward the West Coast. We had been here a few years, and I was pregnant. And we had a 3-year-old. And it was the famous Valentine's flood, now they call it, because it was over Valentine's weekend. They learned a lot about what to expect and bought flood insurance. The next bad deluge was in 1995. After that, Kristen and Dan took out a second mortgage to elevate their living space by eight feet. The most costly storm damage along the West Coast tends to cluster along the Russian River, mostly due to the river overflowing its banks. But we're kind of glued to the various monitors and river monitors. Tim Miller is executive director of West County Community Services. Exactly what level the flood-prone Russian River peaks at determines who is affected and where. Everybody knows what floods at what foot out here. The forecast for Monday predicts many roads will be impassable. So Miller's organization has already shut down its senior center and mental health counseling center, although they're still offering services over the phone. And Miller is evaluating whether those in the homeless shelter need to be bused to higher ground. Additionally, outreach workers have spent days walking creeks and riverbeds speaking to the unhoused who live there. Getting people to move their encampments from 25 feet in the riverbed either into our shelter or just higher up so they're not taken away by the flood. Overall, while Miller is busy getting ready, he's not scared. People out here are generally prepared. They've gone through this many, many times. Like resident Kristen Thurman, who volunteers with West County Community Services. She cooks meals for the nearby homeless shelter. She and Dan are most worried about people who've recently moved to or started businesses in the area. They don't know. They don't know what's coming. I wish that we had more education on what it means to live on a flooding river. In fact, they've wondered if they should run seminars about living with floods to help others prepare. But for now, they're prepping their basement, checking in with neighbors, hunkering down and hoping for the best.For NPR News, I'm Danielle Venton in Monte Rio, Calif. ",Climate

But many public health experts say the EPA needs to do more. NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports. We're talking about soot, the tiny particles that largely come from smokestacks and tailpipes. Vickie Patton works for the Environmental Defense Fund. It harms our hearts and our lungs. It evades kind of all of the defenses that our body has to protect us from harmful air pollution. It's a killer. And some groups are at much higher risk than others. Here's EPA Administrator Michael Regan. Low-income communities and communities of color are at a higher risk for exposure with disproportionately devastating effects. So less soot pollution would save lives, and the EPA sets the official limit for soot pollution. Right now that limit is 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air, which - sure, that number doesn't mean much on its own. But research shows that number is too high. Most scientists who advise the EPA agree that eight to 10 micrograms would be safer. The Environmental Defense Fund commissioned a study to see how many lives would be saved with a lower number. If our nation adopts a standard of eight micrograms per cubic meter, we will save thousands and thousands of lives every year. Nearly 20,000 lives a year, to be more exact. So to recap, eight micrograms is the most stringent choice. Ten is the upper limit of what the science supports. Here's what the EPA proposed today. We're proposing a range of nine to 10. Although Administrator Regan said they've left the door open to go as low as eight or as high as 11. The criticism from top public health experts was swift. The American Lung Association called the proposal inadequate. The EPA is taking public comments on the proposal. Meanwhile, many parts of the country already have more soot pollution than the EPA allows. That means cleaning up trucks and power plants now would save lives even before the agency chooses a new number. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.(, """") ",Climate
https://www.npr.org/2023/01/06/1147545820/why-we-can-and-cannot-collect-rainwater-in-places-like-california,2023-01-06,Why we can — and cannot — collect rainwater in places like California,"Mary Louise Kelly, Erika Ryan, Lee Hale","A bomb cyclone hit California this week, knocking out power, downing trees, dumping massive amounts of water. Now, that last one, massive amounts of water - it's interesting because all that rain is hitting in a state that has been stricken with drought. Some California residents are watching this precious resource wash away and wondering, why can't we save the water for later, for times when we desperately need it? Well, Andrew Fisher, hydrogeologist and professor at UC Santa Cruz, attempted to answer that question in an op-ed for The LA Times. And we have brought him here to try to answer it for us. Professor Fisher, welcome. Thank you. It's good to be here. What is the short answer? How much, if any, of all this rain that has fallen on California this week - how much can be captured for later? Some of it can be captured for later. But the short answer is it falls so quickly that we lack the ability to take that water and set it aside quickly enough in a place where we can store it for later. So it's a storage issue. That's a major challenge - is you have storage tanks, but they're full. And so there's nowhere for it to go. Right. The primary forms of storage for water in California are the snowpack that typically accumulates annually and then reservoirs behind dams and then groundwater aquifers. And the challenge is that when we get a lot of rainfall like this, it's not forming snowpack in lower areas. Sure. It might form some snow at higher elevations. And reservoirs tend to fill up rather quickly, and then we have aquifers. And they have space, but it's hard to get water where it needs to be so it can infiltrate into the ground. And even then, it's hard to get it in fast enough. It sounds like you're describing a number of challenges. There's the storage challenge. There's the, OK, if you have managed to capture and save the water, how do you get it to where you are going to need it at some point down the road? That's a whole different challenge. And then are there also issues with ability to treat the water, that not all the water that gets captured is suitable to push back into people's pipes? Absolutely. These are all challenges, and there are additional challenges. Because the water falls at a very fast rate and it creates a hazard, we do tend to treat storm water as a nuisance and try to get it off the landscape as quickly as possible. So when we have the option to hold that water back a little bit and let it percolate into the ground, this is a tremendous opportunity. However, as you note, sometimes that water is not suitable for drinking. That's an additional bottleneck because you can't treat the water as quickly as it's falling or as quickly as it's running off. And, of course, the level of treatment you need might vary from place to place, and it does create quite a logistical challenge in order to deal with that water. In the meantime, all the extra water that's fallen this week is going where - just running eventually toward the sea? Yeah. It's going to a variety of places. A lot of it will end up rolling out to the ocean. Some of it is being diverted, and we're collecting some of this storm water and directing it towards infiltration basins, where it can percolate into the ground. There are other folks around the state and around the western United States who run similar projects. So people are trying to collect as much of this storm water as we can when we have this opportunity. It turns out a lot of water is falling. A lot of water is running off. So a large part of that does end up flowing out to the ocean. I hear y'all have more rain on the way this weekend. Yeah. That's what we hear. I've got a student group that's out right now sampling from some of our systems, and we dashed out here between the storms because it's an opportunity when it's safe to go collect water samples and see how water quality looks. I'll just note that we have to get more water in the ground. We simply have no choice. UC Santa Cruz Professor Andrew Fisher, thank you. You're welcome. Thank you.(, ""DON'"") ",Environment

The storm knocked out power for tens of thousands of people, caused flash flooding and downed trees, and there is more rain on the way.NPR's Eric Westervelt joins us now from the Bay Area in Northern California with an update on the storm. Hey, Eric. Hey, Juana. This was what's called an atmospheric river, and it was a powerful one. National Weather Service forecasters had issued strong warnings about its potential impact. What's the latest? Yeah, the storm toppled some trees. It knocked down power lines. It flooded some homes and roadways. Power's still out for thousands, mostly in coastal counties stretching from Humboldt in the north to Santa Cruz County, south of the Bay Area. I mean, there were some pretty strong winds, up to 85 miles an hour in some places. The flood threat remains pretty high in several areas. In Sonoma County, for example, they've issued an evacuation warning for residents in low-lying areas along the Russian River.So, I mean, the storm certainly packed a punch. It did some damage, some of it significant, but really not as big a punch as some had feared. I spoke with Rene Mendez, the city manager for Watsonville in Santa Cruz County, which regularly sees flooding during big storms like this. The city lifted its evacuation order today. It wasn't as intense as we expected. Obviously, weather's unpredictable, as we know. It's still sprinkling, still raining, but things are calmer. We lifted the evac order 'cause we have - at least at this point, we feel comfortable to send our residents back. But we're really strongly advising - as you know, this weather pattern is going to continue for a few days - be prepared in case we need to evacuate again. And Juana, Mendez added, you know, now exhausted city crews and first responders can get a little rest and hopefully, you know, start to get back to normal. Yeah. So some officials clearly are breathing a sigh of relief for now. But I understand that the storm did play a role in at least two deaths. Can you tell us what you know about those? Yeah. I spoke with a volunteer fireman with the Occidental fire and rescue in Sonoma County. He was pretty shaken up by the incident and didn't want to go on tape, but he told me the storm knocked a tree onto a double-wide trailer last night, destroying the home. And it struck a toddler. The 2-year-old was pinned in his living room by the tree. They finally got him out under the tree. He went into cardiac arrest. Crews tried to resuscitate him. They did their best, but they could not. And also in Fairfield, just northeast of the Bay Area, police tell us a 19-year-old woman died after her car hydroplaned on a flooded road and then struck a utility pole. Eric, you are in the northern part of the state, but in Southern California, local officials also lifted some evacuation orders. What is the situation there right now? Yeah. In Santa Barbara County outside LA, you know, people were concerned about flooding and additional rain causing debris flows and mudslides. One area in particular, Montecito, was very concerned. They had some evacuation orders there because in 2018, Juana, the area saw a devastating landslide after heavy rains hit an area that had been burned by wildfires. And the mudflows there killed 23 people and destroyed more than 100 homes back then. But today, evacuation orders were lifted. And like in Watsonville, officials are voicing some cautious optimism that things are getting better. You know, this is the latest of three storms to hit the state in the last two weeks, and, as I mentioned, more rain is on the way. I have to imagine that has to have emergency crews quite concerned. Yeah, for sure. I mean, more rain's coming in the weekend and into next week, possibly. So the worry is that this parade of storms is going to really start to cause wider damage, potentially - you know, worries about mudslides, especially in coastal areas as more rain heads here. But the good news is, you know, I think these storms are not expected to be nearly as strong as this atmospheric river that just came through. Good news, indeed.

But NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports slashing greenhouse gas emissions would still make a big difference. There are more than 200,000 glaciers in mountains around the world, and they're shrinking. But predicting how quickly that's happening has been hard because glaciers are really big and often hard to get to. David Rounce is one of the authors of a new study. In the past couple of years, there's really been a revolution in terms of the amount of data. Specifically data from satellites, which allows researchers to peer into the future. And what they found is sobering. Many places are on track to lose virtually all of their glaciers by the end of the century. So areas like western Canada, the contiguous United States, the caucuses and Middle East, Central Europe, a lot of the glaciers in those mountainous regions would be lost completely. In all, the new study estimates that unless emissions fall more quickly, nearly 70% of all glaciers will be gone by 2100. A lot of the glaciers are very small. Which makes them more susceptible to melting, says Rounce. But... The loss of those glaciers could have a really large impact, even though they're small. That's because billions of people live downstream of glaciers and use their meltwater for drinking and irrigation. Glaciers are unique in that they are there all summer long. And so even in times of extreme heat or when you have an extreme drought, the glaciers will be producing meltwater, and they can be a very important buffer in those times of drought. The authors of the study also looked at what would happen if humans reduce greenhouse gas emissions faster. They found it would make a big difference. If humans can keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the goal agreed to by world leaders, it would save an estimated 20% of the world's glaciers this century. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.

Costello drove her car on the flooded street thinking she could make it, but it stalled in the two feet of water., In a world getting used to extreme weather, 2023 is starting out more bonkers than ever and meteorologists are saying it's natural weather weirdness with a bit of help from human-caused climate change., Much of what's causing problems worldwide is coming out of a roiling Pacific Ocean, transported by a wavy jet stream, experts said., At least one highway in drought-mired California looked more like a river because of torrential rain from what is technically called an atmospheric river of moisture. New Year's brought shirtsleeve weather to the U.S. East and record high temperatures to Europe as the Northern Hemisphere on Wednesday was more than 2.6 degrees hotter than the late 20th century average. And this is after frigid air escaped the Arctic to create a Christmas mess for much of the United States., ""All the ingredients are in place for two weeks of wild weather especially in the Western U.S.,"" private meteorologist Ryan Maue said in an email., Maue said the big driver is a three-year La Nina — natural temporary cooling of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that alters world weather patterns — that just won't quit. It is creating literal waves in the weather systems that ripple across the globe. And on certain parts of the waves are storms where the atmospheric pressure drops low and quickly, called bomb cyclones, that are quite wet, and they travel on atmospheric waves that transport the weather called the jet stream., The jet stream now is unusually wavy, said Maue and Woodwell Climate Research Center climate scientist Jennifer Francis. The storms dip over the warm subtropics ""and create a conveyor belt of of moisture to strafe the West Coast of the U.S,"" Maue said., ""I'd describe the jet stream and bomb cyclones as a runaway Pacific freight train loaded with moisture,"" said Maue, former chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Trump administration. ""Climate change adds more fuel to the locomotive engine."", More than 5 inches of rain fell on Saturday in the Sacramento area and California braced for bigger storms Wednesday and Thursday. As of Wednesday, snowpack was third highest in 40 years, more than 170% of normal., In addition to La Nina, a different natural temporary weather event called the Madden-Julian Oscillation enhances storms in the western Pacific, Maue said., Francis points to a ""blob"" of warm sea water off the Aleutian Islands, a phenomena that is happening more often, and a ''crazy warm"" Arctic — Wednesday it was 5.8 degrees warmer than the 1979-2000 average — as part of what's juicing up the Pacific., And with a wavier than normal jet stream, extremes of all kinds go up and down and around the planet, Francis said., ""You can think of it like a jump rope. When you start to flick it at one end, that ripple goes through the whole jump rope eventually,"" Francis said Wednesday. ""And so it could be that the waving as such, being perhaps driven in the Pacific, could be accentuating it also over Europe."", 200 cyclists, some dressed in costumes, ride their bikes Saturday on the ski slopes during the start of the 33rd edition of the 'GP St-Sylvestre', a new-year snow mountain bike race, in the alpine resort of Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerland.

Germany is firing up old coal-burning power plants to fill the void and investing in new, liquefied natural gas facilities. Meanwhile, climate activists there are becoming increasingly disruptive in their protests against fossil fuels. As Esme Nicholson reports, the civil disobedience is unpopular, but support for the message is growing. #1: (Non-English language spoken). It's rush hour on a cold, snowy morning in Berlin. At a highway exit on the western edge of the city, commuter traffic has come to a standstill as a dozen climate activists sit down on a pedestrian crossing and glue themselves to the road. One of them is Lina Johnsen. We're here today because we can't just look and see what the government is doing right now. They're not taking overdue measures to protect future generations' lives. Johnsen and a dozen others sit in front of four lanes of cars and trucks. Some of the drivers rev their engines out of frustration. Others get out of their cars and shout in anger. Johnsen admits she's intimidated, but... I'm more scared of how people will react when we, like, fight for food or drinking water in, like, a few decades. Like, I want to circumvent this, like, future. I don't want this. One driver, 48-year-old Jenni Proller, says she's also anxious about the future of the planet, but that this is not the place to discuss it. (Through interpreter) I have nothing against protests, but this is something else. The gall of these people. I'm trying to get my daughter to an exam. She's a law student and sitting the bar this morning. Another activist, 33-year-old Theodor Schnarr, says he knows he's unpopular. According to a recent poll conducted for Der Spiegel magazine, 86% of Germans disapprove of protesters disrupting their commutes, but 53% agree that the government is not doing enough to tackle climate change. Schnarr has been arrested and locked up twice for stopping traffic. As a biochemist, he says he's all too aware of the science behind the warnings about climate change. If we would compare the situation to war, we wouldn't go on as normal. And we are in a desperate situation. So we also should act like it and implement an emergency economy. This is one of the things that the German government should do. Germany's three-party coalition government is not skimping on spending. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a social Democrat, announced an extra 200 billion euro budget to help cover rocketing energy prices this winter. But this money is paying for fossil fuels replacing Russian gas. The economy and climate protection minister, Robert Habeck, who is a member of the environmentalist Green Party, insists this is a short-term measure. (Through interpreter) The fuel of the future is not coal, gas or oil. Our task is to create a carbon neutral economy. That's why this government will not tolerate NIMBY-ism about wind parks. And it's why we expect everybody to do their bit to help build a future free from fossil fuels. Forty-six percent of Germany's electricity comes from renewable sources. Harbeck is confident he can double this in the next seven years. Christoph Bals from the NGO Germanwatch praises the government for passing ambitious legislation on renewable energy but says it's taking too long to implement because of disagreements between the coalition's three parties. (Through interpreter) Germany is way behind on renewables and embracing electric vehicles because Green Party policies are being blocked and delayed by the libertarian Free Democrats. And that's just two of the three parties in government. Bals says activists who violate the law must face the legal consequences. But he says Germany's highest court has sided with environmentalists before. (Through interpreter) Germany's constitutional court has already ruled that the previous government's lack of action on climate change was unconstitutional. So the same court may well view these protests as legitimate because they aim to protect greater legal interests, namely the fundamental rights of future generations. Police have conducted a number of raids against the group and are investigating whether a recent protest delayed an ambulance from reaching a fatal collision. Schnarr insists they always let the emergency services through. We don't want to endanger people. We don't want to endanger ourselves. This is the very opposite of what our government is doing. #2: (Non-English language spoken). But back on the highway, police struggle to unstick the activists and are unable to let through an ER doctor on his way to hospital. It's clear a sense of urgency and frustration is shared by all.

It's bringing heavy rains and high winds to some areas already saturated by multiple storms in recent weeks. The National Weather Service has sent out dire warnings that flooding, power outages and mudslides are possible. NPR's Eric Westervelt is tracking the storm from the San Francisco Bay area. And, Eric, I've been looking at the weather service's satellite images of this huge storm, and they look really ominous. What's the latest? Yeah, this is a big storm. And, you know, the rain has started to hit parts of northern and southern California. But they're saying the worst of the storm, this massive band of moisture known as an atmospheric river, is going to get more intense later this evening and into Thursday morning. The weather service, Juana, tweeted out, you know, those asking, where's the storm? It's still coming. And they noted that these blue dots in the giant image of the swirling storm you mentioned are lightning flashes. The governor's office today said the state's likely facing the most challenging series of storms it's seen in the last five years. So, Juana, people are kind of holding their breath right now, hoping for the best as more intense rain and wind are starting to hit the state. And California Governor Gavin Newsom has already declared a preemptive state of emergency, and a few communities have also already ordered evacuations ahead of the storm. What can you tell us about that? Yeah, a handful of areas did that, including Watsonville and Santa Cruz County south of San Francisco. The city issued some mandatory evacuations for areas of the city that are prone to flooding, that usually get flooding and, you know, to try to get vulnerable residents, the elderly, to safety. They've opened up an evacuation center. And that's really because a similar weather system moved through the state over the New Year's holiday weekend, causing some dangerous flooding to both homes and businesses in some areas, including parts of San Francisco, Sacramento and Watsonville. And, Juana, the big fear really is that the ground is just, you know, oversaturated from all these storms. And this is the third since Christmas weekend. And this new one, combined with strong winds, could cause some serious damage. I talked with Alison Bridger. She's a meteorologist and climate scientist at San Jose State University. So it's a very strong storm. Plus, a juicy plume of moisture and atmospheric river gives us the possibility of quite a lot of rain, which means all the new rain waters is not going to sink in as well. It's going to run off. And so we're going to have more localized flooding, not to mention trees coming down, mudslides. The good news, Juana, is cities have had a few days to prepare for this, have been handing out lots of sandbags, putting up barriers in places that flood, activating their emergency plans and warning people, hey, stay off the roads if you can, especially in these places that have seen some recent wildfires. And so they're more prone to mudslides and flooding. The irony, though, is that drought-parched California really needs rain, right? Yeah, desperately. I mean, the past three years have been the state's driest on record. And one storm won't get us out of the drought problem. Many of California's largest and most important reservoirs are still far below their historical averages. So I would say Californians are having a bit of a love-hate relationship with this storm. As one meteorologist put it to me today, this rain is really, really good right up until the moment, you know, we're knee deep in floodwater. Another good thing I'll mention briefly, these storms have been incredible for the snowpack in California, which is a major source of both drinking and farming water. The snowpack in the Sierra mountains is off to its best start in 40 years. Briefly, before I let you go, Eric, I understand there are even more storms on the way in the coming days. Yeah. Saturday into Sunday, there's yet another storm coming. It does not look to be nearly as powerful as this one, Juana. But, again, more rain and a saturated ground, the worry is, you know, storm after storm after storm is going to start to really take a toll. NPR's Eric Westervelt in Berkeley, Calif.

Rebecca Blackwell/AP hide caption, A pile of debris from Hurricane Ian rises behind a line of people waiting to vote in Fort Myers, Fla., in November 2022. Research suggests support for some climate policies increases immediately after climate-driven disasters such as Ian., Most people are focused on the present: today, tomorrow, maybe next year. Fixing your flat tire is more pressing than figuring out if you should use an electric car. Living by the beach is a lot more fun than figuring out when your house will be underwater because of sea level rise., That basic human relationship with time makes climate change a tricky problem., ""I consider climate change the policy problem from hell because you almost couldn't design a worse fit for our underlying psychology, or our institutions of decision-making,"" says Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication., Those institutions — including companies and governments that ultimately have the power to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions — can be even more obsessed with the present than individuals are., For example, says Leiserowitz, many companies are focused on quarterly earnings and growth. That helps drive short-term behavior, such as leasing new land to drill for fossil fuels, that makes long-term climate change worse., And there are also big incentives for political leaders to think short-term. ""The president gets elected every four years. Members of the Senate get elected every six years. And members of the House get elected every two years,"" Leiserowitz points out, ""so they tend to operate on a much shorter time cycle than this problem, climate change, which is unfolding over decades."", There are deadlines looming for those elected leaders. The Biden administration pledged to cut emissions in half by 2030. By 2050, humans need to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions entirely in order to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change later this century., Fortunately, our collective focus on the present also offers hints, psychologists say, about how to harness that hyperfocus on the present to inspire action., For example, there are ways to highlight the quick payoff for addressing climate change. In the political realm, that could mean that an elected official gets more votes because they support policies that reduce emissions. The promise of a benefit in the next election may be more galvanizing than the goal of protecting future generations, even if the latter has more moral weight., ""The benefits that we get today are more salient, and we want them more than benefits that may be larger, but will accrue in the future,"" explains Jennifer Jacquet, a researcher and associate professor of environmental studies at New York University who studies the psychology of collective action, including on climate change., Jacquet says the huge spending bill passed last year by Congress, called the Inflation Reduction Act, is another example of using our focus on the present to drive climate-conscious behavior. The bill includes financial incentives for people who buy electric vehicles or install solar panels., ""They're trying to speed up the benefits,"" says Jacquet. ""That's smart. That's good. That plays into how we think about things."", In some ways, our focus on the present is less and less of a problem as climate change makes itself more and more obvious today — in our daily lives. Everyone on Earth is experiencing the effects of a hotter planet. That makes it a problem of the present, not of the future., That immediacy is already showing up in how Americans view climate change, according to Leiserowitz, who has been leading an annual poll on the topic for more than 15 years. As extreme weather is becoming more common, he says support for climate policies is also growing, especially at the local level., For example, the vast majority of respondents in a September 2021 poll said they support local governments providing money to help make homes more energy efficient, to increase public transportation and to install bike lanes. And the majority of respondents supported investments in renewable energy., Widespread public support for climate policies can help push politicians and corporate leaders to act quickly – which is important, because scientists warn that greenhouse gas emissions need to drop dramatically, and immediately, to avoid runaway warming later this century., ""We have big societal choices to make,"" says Leiserowitz, and those changes need to happen now.

The National Weather Service says the, quote, ""brutal"" system could wash out roads and hillsides, flood Bay Area streets and knock out power for much of the state. Well, here to talk about the state's preparations is Brian Ferguson. He's director of crisis communications for California. Brian Ferguson, welcome. Hi, there. Hi. So y'all are just getting walloped, it sounds like. This storm comes just on the heels of a storm over New Year's weekend that broke levees and flooded highways and I know killed several people. How ready is California to confront another big one? You know, California has been preparing for this for a while. We've experienced a number of climate-driven disasters, most notably wildfires. So while we do look forward to a challenging week here that's going to require all of our citizens to be ready, the investments we've made in technology and infrastructure for other climate-driven disasters are going to come into play. You mentioned wildfires, which y'all have also had a lot of in California. And I wonder how that factors in. Are there special concerns in areas where mudslides, flash flooding might be more likely? Yeah, the burn scar areas where we've had wildfires in recent years are more prone to mudslides and debris flows. And similarly, areas that are impacted by the drought - so the creeks and culverts and streambeds - may not be able to receive water the same way that they have in recent years, either because the soil just washes away or because it's so rock-hard that it becomes a bobsled chute of water coming downhill. And certainly, as our climate situation progresses, these can be exacerbating factors to make rain like this even worse when we do have it. Right. Well, because there is, you know, the concern that, as the climate warms, California is seeing more - I've seen the term weather whiplash being used. The dry periods are drier and longer, and then the wet periods are wetter and more extreme storms. How do you think about preparing long term? Yeah, this really is the new reality that we face. And it requires not just government, but individuals to change the way they think about things - whether it's making a plan for your own family and preparing for a disaster on up to us at the state level of taking aggressive action early when we see a weather pattern come in, with ultimately the goal to be - keep as many people safe as possible. We checked with a couple of our colleagues who are in California, in our offices there, and they said I should ask you about just general safety precautions - said a lot of Californians aren't used to this kind of heavy rain, and certainly not back-to-back huge storms. They mentioned things like just knowing to slow down when you're driving through heavy rain. Turn on your headlights. Don't try to just slam through what looks like standing water and you don't know how deep it's going to be. How is your team working to raise awareness of those type of precautions? You know, one thing we always remind people to do is sign up for alerts because information is power. So if you get those notifications from your city or county, don't wait. Go if you think you're in danger and evacuate early, particularly if you have young children or maybe you care for loved ones who are getting up there in age, and you need a little extra time. Because, in a large-scale disaster like this, it may be that first responders can't get to every single house. Any other preparations - any other precautions you want people listening to have in their heads as this storm approaches? One of the things we've done is moved close to 400,000 tons of rock into place, 4 million sandbags, swift water rescue teams on flatbed boats and jet skis and trying to put those in positions across the state. Wow. We're hopeful that we're not going to need them, but the same thing in your family - have a family emergency plan of how you get a hold of your loved ones. If you weren't able to access your cell phone, know where you would meet and what route you would take if maybe the route you typically drive on is flooded or not available. And I have to ask - I'm intrigued by the detail and the scale of the sandbags, which I hear you saying you hope you don't need. Has California ever done anything on this scale before? The last disaster that we saw that was even approaching this scale was 2017, when we saw very challenging releases from our reservoirs and even the possible failure of the Oroville Dam just because of the amount of water that was impacting that area. So certainly, this is not unique to our state, but it's as challenging a storm as we've seen in, you know, five or seven years. Brian Ferguson - he is the state emergency spokesperson for California.

They plan to use their majority to investigate environmental, social and governance investing. It's known as ESG, and it's at the center of a debate over how businesses that control trillions of dollars should respond to climate change. Michael Copley is with NPR's climate desk, and he's following the issue.Hi, Michael. Hey, Leila. OK. So I think people have started to hear this acronym, ESG, more and more. But what exactly are we talking about here? Yeah. I think it gets misunderstood or mischaracterized by supporters and opponents. And what we're talking about is the practice of evaluating risks and opportunities related to environmental, social and governance issues that companies face. The big one right now is climate change. And so the idea is if you can identify the risks and opportunities related to climate change that different companies face, you can find better long-term investments. OK. So what does that look like in practice? Example I hear a lot is if you're investing in beachfront property in South Florida, what are you doing to deal with the threat of rising sea levels? If you're investing in a fossil fuel company, what is it doing to deal with the risk of stricter environmental regulations or competition from stuff like electric vehicles and renewable energy? Now, supporters will say ESG isn't perfect, that investors need better data and that some companies have overpromised and underdelivered on their commitments but that at its core, it's about putting a price tag on risk to help investors decide whether they think companies are making good decisions. OK. So Republicans don't think investors should be making those sort of calculations. I think what we're seeing is that Republicans will often characterize ESG as an attempt to impose liberal or so-called woke policies with the main goal of kind of killing off the fossil fuel industry. Lawmakers in Texas held a hearing on ESG investing in December. Texas has been leading the charge against ESG, and so the hearing did feel like a preview of what we might see from Republicans in Congress. I think this issue of ESG is something that has floated underneath the radar way too long. And I think it's probably one of the existential threats to our economy here in Texas and to the U.S. That's Bob Hall, a Republican state senator in Texas. And, you know, we've heard similar comments from Republicans in Congress. ESG has been described as this cancer within the U.S. economy. I mean, that's really strong words. Are the political attacks having an impact on where money is being invested or the questions investors are asking? You know, I think a lot of big investors genuinely see climate change as a real financial threat. And I don't think these attacks have changed that. Now, what it could do is have a chilling effect on the kinds of positions that companies are willing to take publicly. I spoke to Witold Henisz, the faculty director of the ESG initiative at the Wharton Business School. I think there is a risk of less vocal leadership, and that can have real-world and tangible impacts, particularly on something that is, you know - existential threat like climate. Henisz says leadership is important here because dealing with climate change is going to require bold action, and the threat of political blowback could make companies less willing to do big, ambitious stuff to deal with this complicated problem. So how are supporters of ESG responding? Some want to see companies' investors do a better job of explaining just what it is. They think if ESG is explained in concrete terms, voters will see it as a reasonable way to approach investing. They're also trying to show that these attacks are part of a long-running effort to keep the U.S. from taking action to deal with climate change. NPR climate correspondent Michael Copley, thanks.

https://www.npr.org/2022/12/28/1145763894/morning-news-brief,2022-12-28,Morning news brief,"A Martínez, Leila Fadel","Hundreds of thousands of passengers all over the country have seen their flights on Southwest delayed or canceled. And the airline is still canceling flights right at the peak of the busy holiday season. Tuesday night, Southwest's CEO, Bob Jordan, issued a video pleading with frustrated travelers and frustrated Southwest employees for patience. We're doing everything we can to return to a normal operation. And please also hear that I'm truly sorry. Kyle Arnold covers aviation for The Dallas Morning News, and he's been following this story. Good morning, Kyle. Thanks for having me. So, Kyle, how many flights has Southwest canceled at this point? Up to this point, it's been more than 13,000. And now it's looking at about 2,500 a day, you know, indefinitely until they can get this figured out. So what is happening? What is Southwest saying caused all this? Well, there was a weather issue late last week, if you remember, that really swept through some of the big key airports in Chicago and Denver. But we've seen this at - or with airlines, you know, over the last year and a half, is that when they have these events, they kind of have this crew meltdown where they can't get their planes and pilots and flight attendants in the right places. And when the meltdowns are big enough, they escalate, and they cascade, and they get bigger and bigger over the next few days until the airlines finally have enough slack that they can kind of reset and get everybody back in the right place. But we aren't seeing anywhere near this number of cancellations at other airlines who were also affected by that weather issue. So what's different about Southwest? Well, Southwest has blamed, for one, the position of those - the two big hubs that they hit are really important airports. But second, there's a big technology gap that Southwest has blamed. They just - when these things happen, the systems melt down. It's like a puzzle. That's what Bob Jordan said. And it's like a puzzle that they're doing blind because they don't know where a lot of people are at this point, flight attendants and pilots. They're calling people. They're showing up at airports and calling out names and taking roll of who is where because the system is so out of date. Now, the Department of Transportation tweeted that it will look into what it called Southwest's unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays and reports of lack of prompt customer service. But what can the DOT actually do? Well, they can force Southwest Airlines to give refunds on a lot of these flights. And there's always some contention here whether these were weather-related. I think it's pretty clear that after the first day or two, it wasn't weather-related. But the industry is very wary of additional regulation. And that's what the Biden administration has brought and has threatened over the last year or so since coming out of the pandemic. Those regulations add costs to customers and the airlines and lower the profit margins. Now, what's the airline saying about how it intends to make things right for the hundreds of thousands of passengers affected? It's really hard to make everything right at this point. A lot of people have had their holidays ruined, their vacations upended. They've promised to reimburse reasonable expenses for rental cars, for getting flights on other airlines, for hotels and things like that. But when you've lost a, you know, very important holiday season like this and - you just can't get it back. Yeah, you can't really get back memories that you missed, huh? Kyle Arnold of The Dallas Morning News, thank you so much for all your time. Thank you. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump-era border policy known as Title 42 will remain in place for now.MARTÍ The statute, enacted at the height of the COVID pandemic, allows immigration authorities to turn migrants back without a chance to claim asylum. Immigration advocates say it denies them human rights protections. Lee Gelernt is with the ACLU and an attorney on the case. What the CDC said is there is no longer a public health justification, and the statute on which they were relying allows them only to stop people at the border if there's a public health justification. It cannot be used as a border management tool. For more on what this means, we're joined by Hamed Aleaziz, immigration policy reporter with the LA Times. Good morning. Good morning. So what does this ruling mean in practical terms? Yeah, it means that the status quo at the border remains. This policy that's been in place for almost three years now continues. And migrants who have been waiting at the border in Mexico for a chance to seek asylum will have to wait longer. And if you could just break down, for those hoping to seek asylum, what that means - they just sit at the border? Yeah, well, it's complicated. For certain populations, their chances of asylum were lower under Title 42. Central Americans, for example, have been turned back at the border at high levels. Venezuelans have been turned back to Mexico in recent months. For these groups, seeking asylum has been incredibly difficult. How did this end up before the Supreme Court? Well, a federal judge in November ruled that the policy was arbitrary and capricious, and he ordered the government to undo Title 42 within five weeks, which was December 21. And a group of 19 GOP states tried to intervene in this case, and they asked for a stay with the Supreme Court, hoping to pause this policy while they hope to intervene in the case. And now the Supreme Court's going to be taking those arguments in February. And how does the court's decision now affect the Biden administration immigration policy overall? Yeah, it means that they just continue to have to use Title 42. Earlier this year, they tried to actually undo Title 42, but a judge in Louisiana said that the way they had gone about trying to undo Title 42 was illegal and blocked them from doing that. And they had to continue Title 42, the use of it. They actually expanded it, as I mentioned previously, by using it on Venezuelans - turned back Venezuelans to Mexico. So the administration now has to continue using this Trump-era policy for the time being, potentially into the summer. So it's not something they can just decide not to implement. Not at this point, no. They are bound by that order by the federal court judge in Louisiana, forcing them to continue using Title 42. That case is winding its way through the Fifth Circuit. There are so many twists and turns with this policy at the border. It's incredibly confusing, and there's lack of clarity at times, which is, I think, incredibly distressing to folks in the government and I'm sure to migrants across the border. Hamed Aleaziz is an immigration policy reporter with the LA Times. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Republicans are going to control the House of Representatives in 2023. They plan to use their majority to investigate environmental, social and governance investing.MARTÍ It's known as ESG, and it's at the center of a debate over how businesses that control trillions of dollars should respond to climate change. Michael Copley is with NPR's Climate Desk, and he's following the issue. Hi, Michael. Hey, Leila. OK, so I think people have started to hear this acronym, ESG, more and more. But what exactly are we talking about here? Yeah, I think it gets misunderstood or mischaracterized by supporters and opponents. And what we're talking about is the practice of evaluating risks and opportunities related to environmental, social and governance issues that companies face. The big one right now is climate change. And so the idea is if you can identify the risks and opportunities related to climate change that different companies face, you can find better long-term investments. OK, so what does that look like in practice? The example I hear a lot is if you're investing in beachfront property in South Florida, what are you doing to deal with the threat of rising sea levels? If you're investing in a fossil fuel company, what is it doing to deal with the risk of stricter environmental regulations or competition from stuff like electric vehicles and renewable energy? Now, supporters will say ESG isn't perfect, that investors need better data and that some companies have overpromised and under-delivered on their commitments, but that at its core, it's about putting a price tag on risk to help investors decide whether they think companies are making good decisions. OK, so Republicans don't think investors should be making those sort of calculations? I think what we're seeing is that Republicans will often characterize ESG as an attempt to impose liberal or so-called woke policies, with the main goal of kind of killing off the fossil fuel industry. Lawmakers in Texas held a hearing on ESG investing in December. Texas has been leading the charge against ESG, and so the hearing did feel like a preview of what we might see from Republicans in Congress. I think this issue of ESG is something that has floated underneath the radar way too long. And I think it's probably one of the existential threats to our economy here in Texas and in the U.S. That's Bob Hall, a Republican state senator in Texas. And, you know, we've heard similar comments from Republicans in Congress. ESG has been described as this cancer within the U.S. economy. I mean, that's really strong words.

""And so there are certain compromises that we make for dramatic purposes."", The frustration firefighters feel highlights the disconnect between the portrayal of wildfires in pop culture and the realities of wildfire response in a time of accelerated climate change., Part of the issue is that movies and TV shows about wildfires haven't changed much since they first blazed across our screens in the middle of the last century., Melodramatic scenes of heroic, cleft-chinned firefighters charging fearlessly at enemy fires were a thing back in the 1940s and 1950s in movies like The Forest Rangers and Red Skies of Montana., And they're still very much a thing today, in movies like Only the Brave and Those Who Wish Me Dead, and TV series such as Fire Country and Fire Chasers.Firefighter Bolten said it's high time Hollywood let go of these exaggerated, oversimplified and often inaccurate clichés., Red Skies Of Montana, lobbycard, 1952. LMPC via Getty Images hide caption, ""Its aim is to entertain more than it is to inform,"" Bolten said., Instead, Bolten said, Hollywood should share messages about things like the usefulness of controlled burns to clear out overgrown brush, the public's role in wildfire prevention, and how climate change is turning wildlands across the world into tinderboxes., ""Introducing the complexity of the conversation that's actually happening in fire and climate change and fuels management would be a huge help,"" Bolten said., According to a recent study from the climate change storytelling consultancy Good Energy and the University of Southern California's Norman Lear Center, less than 3% of the more than 37,000 analyzed movie and TV scripts written between 2016 and 2020 made any reference to climate change., ""There is a glaring absence of climate change in scripted media,"" said Good Energy associate director of climate research and consulting Alisa Petrosova. ""And that's a problem because stories set the societal conditions necessary for change. There's a huge power in linking climate change to natural disaster."", However, scenes featuring discussions about climate change or fire prevention and control methods like a homeowner raking leaves off their lawn or a firefighter digging a ditch, don't exactly make for scintillating screen-time., ""Where's the action? Where's the drama?"" said Arizona State University historian Steve Pyne, who studies the portrayal of wildfires in mass entertainment. ""It's very easy to tell the disaster and war story. It's much harder to tell the story of preventative stuff."", Pyne said despite the dramaturgical challenges, the entertainment industry has a responsibility to get the messaging right, because of its enormous reach., ""Most people are not reading policy statements,"" Pyne said. ""They're not reading the Journal of Ecology. They will get it in popular forms."", The official 'Fire Country' trailer, release in May, A few entertainment offerings are leading the way, integrating important — if somewhat less dramatic — topics like fire prevention and climate change into storylines., Good Energy's Petrosova points to a scene from the 2018 movie Roma involving a forest fire., ""The servants line up in a bucket chain to put out the fire while the rich family members sip their wine and take in the spectacle,"" Petrosova said. ""So there's this highlight on injustice and who has to bear the brunt of the labor of the climate crisis and fires."", Fire Country also delivers moments of climate change-focused clarity., For example, in episode seven, the local priest, Father Pascal (played by Barclay Hope), unsuccessfully tries to chat up fire chief Vince Leone (Billy Burke) in order to get out of paying a fine for not clearing the wood around his property., This might not be the most smoldering scene ever written in television history. But executive producer Phelan said moments like this one matter., ""We certainly have a responsibility to tell people about what it means to have development encroaching into these woodland areas, and in order to save property, we are putting people's lives at risk,"" Phelan said., Phelan added audiences can expect to see more climate change-related content on Fire Country as the season continues. CBS will likely make a decision about whether to commission a second series next spring.",Culture

This luxury for the nation's wealthiest comes at the environmental expense of people living near airports. Caleigh Wells of member station KCRW reports. The wealth gap is especially visible here in Van Nuys, a dense, working-class neighborhood, home to one of the busiest general aviation airports in the country. Among those protesting the increased flights here is sociology professor Karen Morgaine. You have the 1% using this airport in a working-class neighborhood, disproportionately affecting the environment right now in this neighborhood, in addition to increasing the impact on the climate. Although it's convenient for the wealthy, private jet travel is also one of the most carbon-intensive things a person can do, spewing about two metric tons of carbon every hour. The people living in Van Nuys are mostly renters, majority Latino, and households here typically make less than $60,000 per year. That's roughly the cost of a round-trip private flight from LA to New York. Suzanne Gutierrez-Hedges lives nearby, and she's worried about how those flights are affecting her kids' health.- Just this morning, as we were walking outside to take my kids to school and getting in the car, I was like, cover your nose. Run to the car. Get in the car. Shut the door. We couldn't breathe because of the jet fumes. And it happens all the time. Gutierrez-Hedges recorded the jets flying over her daughter's school one day. She counted four of them in nine minutes. KCRW contacted 11 jet companies operating out of Van Nuys multiple times. Two declined to comment. The rest never responded. The Van Nuys Airport supports 10,000 jobs and says it contributes more than $2 billion to the area economy. Earlier this year, it improved the runway and let private companies build new hangars, so traffic has increased. But Samantha Bricker with Los Angeles World Airport says the air traffic itself isn't in the airport's hands. We can't regulate the number of flights coming into Van Nuys. We can't institute a cap. We have no ability to close down the airport at a certain hour. Those are just things that are not allowed under FAA regulations. The FAA said in a statement that they work with airports to address community concerns. They also said they'd review plane operation restrictions at Van Nuys if Los Angeles World Airports ever proposed any. The airport is offering cleaner jet fuel and requesting that planes not fly at night to curb noise and pollution, but those moves are only voluntary. So just how bad is the air in Van Nuys? Actually, we don't know. Bricker says the latest local study on the airport was done 17 years ago, and there's no plan to do another one. Most of the pollution was coming from roadway vehicle emissions as the highest source of pollutants, and it was not the aircraft. And so, you know, there has not been a need for a new study because the feeling was that the findings for that study are still relevant. The airport makes that argument even though private jet travel has increased 15% since the pandemic, and cars have gotten cleaner. The EPA did study toxic lead levels five years ago. Van Nuys was the seventh-worst airport in the country, with more than twice as many people living nearby than any of the other most polluted airports. Only the federal government can regulate airplane emissions, and those don't go into effect until 2028. But resident Susanne Gutierrez-Hedges says she and her kids couldn't leave this polluted neighborhood even if they wanted to.GUTIERREZ- And where would we move to? Like, we couldn't afford another house here in Los Angeles. Because like a lot of people in Southern California, the only home she can afford here is the one she already has.

Police unstick their hands using cooking oil and a pastry brush while irate drivers look on, stuck for more than an hour., BERLIN — It's rush hour on a cold, snowy morning in Berlin. Commuter traffic has come to a standstill at a highway exit on the western edge of the city, as a dozen climate activists sit down on a pedestrian crossing in front of four lanes of cars and trucks., The activists belong to a group called Letzte Generation, or Last Generation. Like many scientists, they argue that it'll be too late for future generations to stop the climate crisis if governments don't act now., Lina Johnsen, a member of the group, looks cold as she finishes sticking her chapped, ungloved hands to the icy tarmac using industrial-strength superglue., ""We're here today because we can't just look and see what the government is doing right now,"" says Johnsen, a 24-year-old university student focusing on environmental science. ""They're not taking overdue measures to protect future generation's lives."", Germany, Europe's largest economy, is racing to replace Russian natural gas after Moscow cut off a key pipeline over the summer. At odds with the government's climate protection promises, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition is investing more in fossil fuels, not less. It's firing up old coal power plants and investing in an entirely new liquefied natural gas infrastructure to fill the void left by the now-defunct Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline., As a result, climate activists like Johnsen are carrying out increasingly disruptive protests on an almost daily basis. Some days it's on a major city thoroughfare; on others, the runway at Munich or Berlin airports., Sitting with others who've glued themselves to the road at a recent protest, Johnsen is blinded by the headlights of the vehicles the activists are holding up., Some of the drivers rev their engines out of frustration. Others get out of their cars and shout in anger., Johnsen admits she's intimidated, but it pales in comparison with the bigger picture: ""I'm more scared of how people will react when we fight for food or drinking water in a few decades,"" she says. ""I want to circumvent this future. I don't want this."", One driver, 48-year-old Jenni Pröller, says she's also anxious about the planet's future but this is not the place to discuss it. ""I have nothing against protests, but this is something else! The gall of these people!"" Pröller shouts. ""I'm trying to get my daughter to an exam. She's a law student and sitting the bar this morning."", Another activist, 33-year-old Theodor Schnarr, says he knows he's unpopular. According to a recent poll conducted for Der Spiegel magazine, 86% of Germans disapprove of protesters disrupting their commutes, but 53% agree that the government is not doing enough to tackle climate change., Police officers move Letzte Generation activists blocking the end of a highway during a protest against food waste on Jan. 24, near Berlin. Hannibal Hanschke/Getty Images hide caption, Police officers move Letzte Generation activists blocking the end of a highway during a protest against food waste on Jan. 24, near Berlin., Schnarr has been arrested and locked up twice for stopping traffic. As a biochemist, he says he's all too aware of the science and warnings of climate change., Burning fossil fuels is speeding up climate change that's already causing catastrophic consequences in the world, and scientists warn it will worsen as nations fail to make dramatic cuts to harmful gas emissions., ""If we would compare the situation to a war, we wouldn't go on as normal,"" Schnarr says. ""And we are in a desperate situation. So we also should act like it and implement an emergency economy. This is one of the things that the German government should do."", Less than a week after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Economy and Climate Protection Minister Robert Habeck warned that Germany may have to resort to using more fossil fuels in the short term to secure its energy supply., ""When it comes to guaranteeing energy supplies, pragmatism beats any political determination,"" Habeck told public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk., This fall, Scholz — the Social Democratic chancellor who formed a government with two other parties — announced an extra 200 billion euros (about $212 billion) to help cover rocketing energy prices in the coming season. This money is paying for the fossil fuels replacing Russian gas., Now Habeck — a member of the environmentalist Green Party — is the Cabinet minister responsible for finding these fossil fuels. He insists measures like his LNG deal with Qatar are short-term solutions., But in a recent interview with public broadcaster ZDF, he argued for a clean energy path forward. ""The fuel of the future is not coal, gas or oil,"" he said. ""Our task is to create a carbon-neutral economy. ... It's why we expect everybody to do their bit to help build a future free from fossil fuels."", About 46% of the country's electricity has come from renewable sources this year, according to Germany's environmental agency. Habeck is confident he can double that in the next seven years., An aerial view of wind turbines producing electricity spin over a solar park on Nov. 1, near Klettwitz, Germany. The German government is seeking an accelerated transition to renewable energy sources in order to both meet its climate goals and to reduce its import needs of fossil fuels.

The German government is seeking an accelerated transition to renewable energy sources in order to both meet its climate goals and to reduce its import needs of fossil fuels., Christoph Bals, policy director at the nonprofit Germanwatch, says it's taking too long to implement the government's ambitious legislation on renewable energy because of disagreements among the coalition's three parties., ""Germany is way behind on renewables and embracing electric vehicles because Green Party policies are being blocked and delayed by the libertarian Free Democrat members of Cabinet,"" he tells NPR., The Free Democratic Party transport and justice ministers are among those calling for tougher punishment for climate activists occupying roads and airport runways., Bals says while he understands the activists' frustrations about increased use of gas and coal, those who violate the law face legal consequences. But, he says, the highest court has sided with environmentalists before., ""Germany's constitutional court has already ruled that the previous government's lack of action on climate change was unconstitutional,"" Bals says, referring to a decision in 2021. ""So the same court may well view these protests as legitimate because they aim to protect greater interests, namely the fundamental rights of future generations."", Police officers guard the chancellery after Letzte Generation activists threw black paint on it in Berlin, on June 22.

Derocher was not involved in the study., Since the 1980s, the number of bears in the region has fallen by nearly 50%, the authors found. The ice essential to their survival is disappearing., Polar bears rely on arctic sea ice — frozen ocean water — that shrinks in the summer with warmer temperatures and forms again in the long winter. They use it to hunt, perching near holes in the thick ice to spot seals, their favorite food, coming up for air. But as the Arctic has warmed twice as fast as the rest of the world because of climate change, sea ice is cracking earlier in the year and taking longer to freeze in the fall., That has left many polar bears that live across the Arctic with less ice on which to live, hunt and reproduce., Polar bears are not only critical predators in the Arctic. For years, before climate change began affecting people around the globe, they were also the best-known face of climate change., Researchers said the concentration of deaths in young bears and females in Western Hudson Bay is alarming., ""Those are the types of bears we've always predicted would be affected by changes in the environment,"" said Stephen Atkinson, the lead author who has studied polar bears for more than 30 years., Young bears need energy to grow and cannot survive long periods without enough food and female bears struggle because they expend so much energy nursing and rearing offspring., ""It certainly raises issues about the ongoing viability,"" Derocher said. ""That is the reproductive engine of the population."", The capacity for polar bears in the Western Hudson Bay to reproduce will diminish, Atkinson said, ""because you simply have fewer young bears that survive and become adults.""",Climate

Prisma Bildagentur/Universal Images Group via Getty Images hide caption, In the coastal community of Kotzebue, Alaska, climate change is threatening the way of life for Native communities who have been living there for generations., The Arctic is warming faster than any place on earth. For Indigenous communities in Alaska, that means adapting to the changing climate, or moving elsewhere., ""Alaska Native communities and our people are on the front lines of climate change,"" says Jackie Qataliña Schaeffer, who co-authored a recent federal report on Arctic warming. Schaeffer, an Inupiaq from the coastal community of Kotzebue, has seen her home change drastically over the decades., ""I grew up on a rocky beach where all our subsistence activities took place,"" she says. Over time, the beach began to erode, a seawall was built, but that hasn't insulated her community from flooding as the climate warms., ""The Arctic itself, you have to consider it the cooling system for the planet,"" Schaeffer says., A cooling system indeed. A strong Arctic high pressure system is sweeping across much of the United States this week, and bringing with it bitter cold. More broadly, snow and ice in the Arctic reflect the Sun's heat and help control the temperature of the entire globe. But climate change is causing that snow and ice to disappear., National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration director Rick Spinrad recently warned that what's happening in the Arctic now – the dramatic warming – could forecast what's to come for the rest of the globe. Once consistently frigid and frozen, over the decades the Arctic has become wetter and stormier – and threatened the health and livelihoods of Native communities., In September 2022, typhoon Merbok revealed ""the inextricable linkage of environmental change and impacts on human safety, food security, and health,"" according to the report from NOAA. ""The storm – fueled by unusually warm water in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean – flooded several Bering Sea communities; damaged or destroyed homes, hunting camps, boats, and other subsistence infrastructure."", It was the strongest storm to hit Alaska in decades., With the loss of sea ice, coastal communities have been inundated with flooding. Many of these communities are remote and ""logistically removed from the road system,"" Schaeffer says, accessible only by boat or plane., Thawing ice, more severe storms, and wildfires are already risking public health, food and water security and even spirituality and cultural traditions tied to the land., Schaeffer, who serves as director of climate initiatives for the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, collaborated with dozens of others in a study of environmental change in the Arctic., ""Arctic Indigenous Peoples interact intimately with their environments,"" their report states. ""For example, the distribution, quality, thickness, and timing of ice on the ocean, lakes, and rivers drive nearly every aspect of life on Arctic coasts, from boating to whaling and seal hunting to the safety of fishing and foraging."", Relocation is an option, Schaeffer says, but it's not so easily accomplished., ""It's not like we have the privilege of migrating away from danger anymore, because of land designation and landownership. Working with federal partners is important because 65% of Alaska is federal land,"" she adds. ""And so we have to look at it now through a different lens."", In many Indigenous communities, anywhere from 60 to 80% of households depend on wildlife for food. ""And so when climate changes that land base, now those things are compromised,"" Schaeffer says., But Schaeffer is hopeful. She sees solutions in aligning Indigenous and scientific knowledge., ""Indigenous people have this symbiotic dance with nature,"" Schaeffer says. ""We are constantly in nature. Every season...there's some type of traditional activity that's attached to seasonal change."", Earlier this month, three Tribal communities in Alaska and Washington that have been severely impacted by climate change received $75 million from the Biden administration to help relocate to higher ground., Schaeffer says finding solutions requires a shift in how we look at and interact with the planet. It is a lesson that can be learned from Indigenous people who have survived, and continue to survive, amid ever-accumulating crises., Preserving coastal communities requires some engineering, whether constructing seawallsor safeguarding land from further erosion. But in some cases, mitigation measures are not enough, and relocation to higher ground is necessary to evade the rising seas., ""We try to remind our communities that just a few centuries ago we were all migratory,"" Schaeffer says., The audio interview was edited by Amra Pasic.

Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP hide caption, A volunteer carries a cardboard cutout of mountain lion P-22 during the groundbreaking ceremony for the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing in Agoura Hills, Calif., in April., Los Angeles is mourning its beloved mountain lion P-22, who was euthanized over the weekend due to health issues including injuries sustained from a vehicle strike., It's a tragic ending for an animal who made his name by traversing two major freeways — a dangerous and unprecedented feat — to take up a lonely residence in Griffith Park. Over his 12 years, P-22 came to symbolize the challenges facing urban wildlife as well as one particularly groundbreaking effort to protect it., That's the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, a vegetated overpass that will eventually link the Santa Monica Mountains to the Simi Hills, reconnecting an ecosystem that has long been fragmented by a major freeway., The 210-foot crossing will span 10 lanes of the U.S.-101 Hollywood/Ventura Freeway, and is set to be the first of its kind in California and the largest in the world when it is completed in 2025. Construction on the project, supported through a public-private partnership, started in April after decades of research and years of fundraising., In statements mourning P-22's death, wildlife advocates, government agencies and California Gov. Gavin Newsom credited the cougar with inspiring conservation efforts and said the Hollywood icon's legacy will live on., ""The Annenberg Wildlife Crossing did not come soon enough for P-22, but it will protect future mountain lions and other animals and ensure a safer future for them and our planet,"" the Annenberg Foundation said in a statement., Beth Pratt, the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation, told Morning Edition that P-22's story both showed why such a crossing is necessary and helped to make it a reality., ""He wasn't just a celebrity influencer. He was someone who used his celebrity for good ... and put a real story to the impact of these highways,"" she said. ""And here we are with the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing. We got donations from all over the world and it's because of him."", P-22 made his way to Hollywood from the Santa Monica Mountains by crossing two of the busiest freeways in the world, then proceeded to live in Griffith Park — ""the smallest home range that has ever been recorded for an adult male mountain lion,"" per the National Park Service — for more than a decade., ""It's a remarkable story ... nobody would predict that a mountain lion would march 50 miles across two of the busiest freeways, through Beverly Hills, close to Hollywood Boulevard to make a home under the Hollywood sign,"" Pratt says., He became a local legend, sometimes appearing in neighborhoods (once underneath an LA home) and captivating residents with his hijinks (including a dramatic recovery from rat poison)., The so-called ""Brad Pitt of mountain lions"" gained further notoriety after National Geographic published a photograph of him beneath the Hollywood Sign (right on his home turf) in 2013., Photographer Steve Winter, who captured the now-iconic shot, told NPR's All Things Considered this week that he was blown away by the reaction to the image, and is confident P-22's legacy will live on., ""I think we owe it to P-22 and all California wildlife to build more crossings and to connect more habitat. That's what is needed,"" he said. ""I mean, now they're teaching wildlife and P-22 in the greater LA school district. And every Oct. 22 is P-22 Day in LA. His legacy will live for years, if not decades, to come. No one's going to forget P-22."", P-22's solitary survival story inspired many in LA and beyond. But, as the National Park Service said, he was ""more than just a celebrity cat."", ""He was also a critical part of a long-term research study and a valuable ambassador for the cause of connectivity and for wildlife in the Santa Monica Mountains and beyond,"" it said, adding that scientists will continue to analyze his data for years to come., Pratt — who has a P-22 tattoo and a wardrobe of items with his face on them — told Morning Edition that the mountain lion also helped connect people to each other, and to ""the wild world that needs saving."", ""That cat, through inspiring us, showed us what was possible,"" she said. ""He made us more human. He made us realize, even in the second-largest city in the country, that we needed a connection to wildlife."", An overview of the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, which will eventually be built over the 101 Freeway in Agoura Hills, Calif. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP hide caption, An overview of the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, which will eventually be built over the 101 Freeway in Agoura Hills, Calif., Decades of research underscore the need for a wildlife crossing to protect the flora and fauna of the Santa Monica Mountains, which have been isolated by development and highly trafficked roads., At least 29 mountain lions have been killed by vehicles in the park service's study area — which includes the Santa Monica range, Simi Hills, Santa Susana Mountains, Verdugo Mountains and Griffith Park — since 2002, and at least four have died on roadways this year alone., A 1990 study commissioned by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy identified this particular site — the Liberty Canyon Wildlife Crossing — as the necessary place to connect the mountains in order to prevent the local mountain lion population from extinction. Over the next three decades, the conservancy and other partners acquired much of that land (which had been largely privately owned) to make it possible to link the two areas., ""The purpose of the project is to provide a safe and sustainable passage for wildlife across US-101 near Liberty Canyon Road in the City of Agoura Hills that reduces wildlife death and allows for the movement of animals and the exchange of genetic material,"" the conservancy explains. ""Without a safe and sustainable wildlife crossing, movement between these remaining areas of natural habitat is severely restricted and wildlife within the Santa Monica Mountains is essentially trapped."", Pratt explains that as it stands, the isolation of the Santa Monica Mountains creates a sort of ""extinction vortex"" where mountain lions are trapped (P-22 was one of the few to make it out alive) and forced to breed with their own family members, diminishing their genetic diversity and risking future generations' ability to reproduce., Advocates hope the crossing will help protect and promote ecological connectivity not just for mountain lions, but other forms of wildlife from bobcats to birds to lizards. It will offer safe passage for these animals to meet — and reproduce with — more members of their species. Pratt says it's especially important for the mountain range to be resilient in the face of threats like climate change and wildfires., The question is: What will make such a crossing appealing to animals who may be wary of the roaring traffic?, Pratt says it's going to be covered with vegetation, to help minimize the sound and light from outside and essentially trick the creatures into thinking they're not walking over a freeway. Picture a ""beautiful ecosystem"" with ""trees and butterflies flying over it,"" she says., ""And what I love to imagine is here we are in one of the busiest commuter roads and you're going to have people commuting, you know, (300,000) to 400,000 cars a day,"" she adds. ""And once this is finished, while they're doing that, they're going to be driving under the structure [and] a mountain lion will be crossing over. That, to me, is pretty hopeful."", The audio for this story was produced by Milton Guevara and Iman Maani, and edited by Amra Pasic.",Environment

But the change is not the same everywhere. And the waters off the west coast of Ecuador's Galapagos Islands are actually getting colder. And that cool water creates a refuge from climate change for coral reefs, birds and marine animals.MARTÍ A researcher at the University of Colorado, Boulder, says he knows why this region keeps cool. It's called the equatorial undercurrent. And it flows eastward along the Pacific Ocean. Kris Karnauskas is an associate professor of atmospheric and oceanic science. He says when that undercurrent hits the islands, it pushes cool, nutrient-rich water to the surface. Which is essentially what sustains life in the marine realm.MARTÍ Karnauskas and his team analyzed satellite data. They found the water in the area has cooled by about 1 degree Fahrenheit over the past 40 years. That's quite an interesting trend, considering most of the rest of the world ocean is warming. And the equatorial undercurrent isn't just cooling. It's actually been strengthening. And of course, the longer that holds on, the better for the ecosystem in that region.MARTÍ Karnauskas hopes to put off the day when it changes. If it's the type of ecosystem that might have a little bit of an extra running start in the fight against climate change, you know, it might hold on longer. It might enable other regions to hold on and to survive. And I would say that it's a candidate for taking an extra close look at trying to really conserve this region.MARTÍ Karnauskas hopes that if this area is protected, it could possibly serve as a gene bank to help restore biodiversity in marine ecosystems in other parts of the world.(' """") ",Climate

The U.S. Forest Service hide caption, Tree health specialists scan forests, looking for fir trees that have turned red, which indicates that they are dead., Flying over Oregon's woodlands, tree health specialist Danny DePinte was stunned by what he saw: a stretch of dead fir that seemed to go on and on., ""As we continued to fly along, it just kept going. It didn't stop for miles and miles,"" DePinte, who conducts research in the Pacific Northwest region for the U.S. Forest Service, told NPR., Since 1947, the U.S. has been conducting annual aerial surveys across the country to monitor the health of trees. Flying up to 2,000 feet in the air, observers scan terrain in a grid-like pattern, analyzing about 30 acres per second, DePinte said. With a tablet, a pen and a trained eye, they are able to spot and diagnose unhealthy trees based on their color, posture and fullness., This year, tree health specialists expected to see some mortality in Oregon following the state's recent droughts, but many were still shocked by the sheer number of trees that fell ill., Preliminary figures indicate that 1.1 million acres showed fir trees with some signs of dying — almost double the previous all-time high for the state since the survey began 75 years ago. It's led some researchers to call the season of historic die-offs as ""firmageddon."", Tree mortality is not inherently concerning, but some forest landowners describe the unprecedented number of dying trees, which were largely concentrated in southwest Oregon, as a warning sign., ""It is an indicator that we need to pay attention and do what we can to manage our forests to remain healthy,"" Mike Barsotti, the communications chair of the Oregon Tree Farms System, told NPR., Tree deaths in Oregon have been an issue over the past decade, and it's been especially prominent in recent years., In 2019, about 470,000 acres contained dead trees, DePinte said. Last year, Oregon researchers identified at least 147,000 acres with fir tree deaths — though the survey was not complete because of summer wildfires, according to DePinte., Still, the 2021 aerial survey report said that Oregon's forests, which make up nearly half the state, have been ""pushed to the limit due to climate change."", There is still a lot to understand about all the factors that cause high levels of tree mortality, but DePinte said it's clear that Oregon's extreme drought has been a major stressor on the state's trees, making them more vulnerable to insects and diseases., And it's not just Oregon., A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change earlier this year found that the Western U.S. has been experiencing a ""megadrought,"" a multidecade dry spell unlike any other period in more than a millennium — in part because of greenhouse gas emissions warming the world., Alongside threatening trees, those dry conditions also have been hurting crops and wildlife., There is still a lot to understand about the widespread loss, according to DePinte., ""It's not apocalyptic,"" he said. ""But when forests change in a dramatic way, it's noteworthy."", In response to the ongoing heat, some landowners have begun planting new species of trees that are able to better withstand dry conditions, according to Oregon Tree Farm Systems' Barsotti. Others have begun embracing thinner, less-crowded forests, which can bolster tree health., ""Trees are an important part of who we are, how we live,"" said Barsotti, who is also a forest landowner in northwest Oregon. ""We need to work to have our forests as resilient and sustainable as possible."", While there's concern that the extreme heat and die-offs may reshape Oregon's woodlands, dead trees also play an important role in nature. They create habitats for wildlife and produce material that — once decomposed — becomes soil. They may also lead to forests that can better withstand droughts., ""The trees that were left are maybe in a better location, and that's how they got to survive through this drought,"" he said. ""Or maybe they have some sort of special genetics that makes them more drought-resistant."", DePinte said only time will tell how Oregon's forests will fare. He and other tree health specialists across the country are expected to convene and share their aerial survey findings during a national meeting early next year.",Environment

Ryan Remiorz/AP hide caption, The head table gets set to open the high level segment at the COP15 biodiversity conference in Montreal on Dec. 15, 2022., MONTREAL — Negotiators reached a historic deal at a U.N. biodiversity conference early Monday that would represent the most significant effort to protect the world's lands and oceans and provide critical financing to save biodiversity in the developing world., The global framework comes a day before the United Nations Biodiversity Conference, or COP15, is set to end in Montreal. China, which holds the presidency at this conference, released a new draft earlier in the day that gave the sometimes contentious talks much-needed momentum., The most significant part of the agreement is a commitment to protect 30% of land and water considered important for biodiversity by 2030. Currently, 17% of terrestrial and 10% of marine areas are protected., ""There has never been a conservation goal globally at this scale,"" Brian O'Donnell, the director of the conservation group Campaign for Nature, told reporters. ""This puts us within a chance of safeguarding biodiversity from collapse ... We're now within the range that scientists think can make a marked difference in biodiversity."", The draft also calls for raising $200 billion by 2030 for biodiversity from a range of sources and working to phase out or reform subsidies that could provide another $500 billion for nature. As part of the financing package, the framework calls for increasing to at least $20 billion annually by 2025 the money that goes to poor countries — or about double what is currently provided. That number would increase to $30 billion each year by 2030., Some advocates wanted tougher language around subsidies that make food and fuel so cheap in many parts of the world. The document only calls for identifying subsidies by 2025 that can be reformed or phased out and working to reduce them by 2030., ""The new text is a mixed bag,"" Andrew Deutz, director of global policy, institutions and conservation finance for The Nature Conservancy, said. ""It contains some strong signals on finance and biodiversity but it fails to advance beyond the targets of 10 years ago in terms of addressing drivers of biodiversity loss in productive sectors like agriculture, fisheries, and infrastructure and thus still risks being fully transformational."", The ministers and government officials from about 190 countries have mostly agreed that protecting biodiversity has to be a priority, with many comparing those efforts to climate talks that wrapped up last month in Egypt., Climate change coupled with habitat loss, pollution and development have hammered the world's biodiversity, with one estimate in 2019 warning that a million plant and animal species face extinction within decades — a rate of loss 1,000 times greater than expected. Humans use about 50,000 wild species routinely, and 1 out of 5 people of the world's 8 billion population depend on those species for food and income, the report said., But they have struggled for nearly two weeks to agree on what that protection looks like and who will pay for it., The financing has been among the most contentions issues, with delegates from 70 African, South American and Asian countries walking out of negotiations Wednesday. They returned several hours later., Brazil, speaking for developing countries during the week, said in a statement that a new funding mechanism dedicated to biodiversity should be established and that developed countries provide $100 billion annually in financial grants to emerging economies until 2030., ""All the elements are in there for a balance of unhappiness which is the secret to achieving agreement in U.N. bodies,"" Pierre du Plessis, a negotiator from Namibia who is helping coordinate the African group, told The Associated Press. ""Everyone got a bit of what they wanted, not necessarily everything they wanted. Let's see if there is there is a spirit of unity."", Others praised the fact the document recognizes the rights of Indigenous communities. In past biodiversity documents, indigenous rights were often ignored and they rarely were part of the larger discussions other than a reference to their traditional knowledge. The framework would reaffirm the rights of Indigenous peoples and ensure they have a voice in any decision making., ""It's important for the rights of Indigenous peoples to be there, and while it's not the exact wording of that proposal in the beginning, we feel that it is a good compromise and that it addresses the concerns that we have,"" Jennifer Corpuz, a representative of the International Indigenous Forum on Biodiversity said. ""We believe that it's a good basis for us to be able to implement policy at the national level."", But the Wildlife Conservation Society and other environmental groups were concerned that the draft puts off until 2050 a goal of preventing the extinction of species, preserving the integrity of ecosystems and maintaining the genetic diversity within populations. They fear that timeline is not ambitions enough.",Climate

Matrix paid six news sites that attacked officials who challenged the companies., NPR's David Folkenflik reported this story with Mario Ariza and Miranda Green of Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powerful interests stalling climate action., Terry Dunn couldn't fathom why Alabama's residents — among the poorest in the U.S. — pay some of the nation's most expensive electricity bills., So in 2010, Dunn ran for a seat on the state commission that sets energy prices. He promised to hold a formal rate hearing at which Alabama Power executives would have to open their financial books and answer questions, under oath and in public. That hadn't happened for nearly three decades., After winning, Dunn says, a top lobbyist for the utility took him aside and promised he could hold his roughly $100,000-a-year position on the commission for years — as long as he remained a team player. (Alabama Power declined to make the executive available to address the accusation; the utility and its corporate parent, Southern Company, declined all comment for this story.), ""They didn't take me serious,"" Dunn says now., Dunn, a Republican and Tea Party conservative, plowed ahead. And soon enough, he found himself the target of a political pressure campaign, replete with character assassinations and online smears., Attacks began in online news outlets in 2013. One headline in Yellowhammer News read: ""Democrats Embrace Republican Public Service Commissioner Terry Dunn."", In a June 2014 column, Alabama Political Reporter's editor in chief, Bill Britt, cast Dunn as a pawn of his own aide, a Democrat., ""For some Dunn is a populist hero; for others, he's a radical environmentalist,"" Britt wrote. He saw Dunn as manipulated by those who ""find companies like Alabama Power a convenient political target."", These were devastating portrayals for Dunn in a deeply red state., ""Mostly everything was all made up,"" he says. ""You get to thinking, 'Why are they attacking me?' I'm just telling the truth and trying to do what's right for the people."", Floodlight and NPR have not been able to independently verify whether Alabama Power directed or had prior notice of the sharply critical coverage aimed at Dunn., In 2014, Dunn lost his reelection bid by 19 percentage points — to a catfish farmer who had previously served as a county commissioner., Eight years after Dunn's defeat, Alabama has still not held a rate hearing on electricity prices. Alabama Power remains one of the most profitable utility companies in the country., Terry Dunn, a former Alabama public service commissioner, stands in front of an Alabama Power substation. Joe Songer for Floodlight hide caption, Terry Dunn, a former Alabama public service commissioner, stands in front of an Alabama Power substation., Yellowhammer News and Alabama Political Reporter offer clashing ideologies - one hardline conservative, the other centrist - and appear simply to be competitors. Owners of the two sites separately defend their coverage, saying they are independent news outlets., In reality, they are among six news outlets across Alabama and Florida with financial connections to the consulting firm Matrix LLC, a joint investigation by Floodlight and NPR finds. The firm, based in Montgomery, Alabama, has boasted clients including Alabama Power and another major U.S. utility, Florida Power & Light., In addition to Yellowhammer and The Alabama Political reporter, the sites include Alabama Today, The Capitolist, Florida Politics and the now-defunct Sunshine State News., A tally of the five still-functioning sites show they have a collective audience of 1.3 million unique monthly visitors. Many of their consumers are political professionals, business leaders and journalists — people who help set the agenda for lawmakers and talk radio shows in both states., These readers have been unknowingly immersing themselves in an echo chamber of questionable coverage for years., Matrix shrewdly took advantage of the near collapse of the local newspaper industry and a concurrent plunge in trust in media in propelling its clients' interests., ""The reduction in just the size of the press corps covering state government has created a vacuum that I think tends to be filled by people who have agendas beyond serving the public interest,"" says former Miami Herald executive editor Tom Fiedler., A core tenet of U.S. journalism holds that reporting should be fair and transparent, unaffected by financial backers who may have their own hidden interests. News outlets are supposed to hold the powerful to account and give people the knowledge to make choices as informed citizens., The public bears the brunt of deep cuts in conventional newsroom staffs, Fiedler says, as those driving the news agenda at some newer outlets are often ""the special interests - in many cases, the monied interests."", In Alabama and Florida, Matrix sought to ensure much coverage was secretly driven by the priorities of its clients. Payments flowed as the utilities in Florida and Alabama fought efforts to incorporate more clean energy in electric grids — a fight they are still waging., For this investigation, Floodlight and NPR drew upon hundreds of internal Matrix documents and public records, more than three dozen interviews, a review of social media postings, and an original analysis of coverage., Those accounts reflect a complex web of financial links, in which the six outlets collectively received, at minimum, $900,000 from Matrix, its clients, and associated entities between 2013 and 2020., All of the media organizations deny their coverage was shaped by those payments and deny they acted unethically., The founder of Matrix, Joe Perkins, says the firm paid news sites only for advertising and other run-of-the-mill services for its clients. He also denies Matrix paid anything at all to two of the sites. Beyond that, Perkins has consistently called the firm's former CEO, Jeff Pitts, a ""rogue employee"" and, in a lawsuit, alleges Matrix is not responsible because the former executive acted without his knowledge or his firm's consent. Pitts did not respond to several detailed requests for comment. In court filings, Pitts says Perkins knew everything–and he accused Perkins of wrongdoing., They also cast blame on one another over a series of recent scandals. Matrix recently made headlines for surveillance of a power company CEO and a journalist who wrote critically about Florida Power & Light's business plans. Matrix has also been accused of seeking to influence ballot initiatives on clean energy and offering a lucrative job to a public official in Jacksonville to induce him to resign. Florida Power & Light did not respond to a detailed list of questions, and an executive for the company declined to address them in a phone call., Alabama Power begins putting up poles to get power restored in Beauregard, Ala., after a tornado in 2019.

For example, Sunshine State News emerged when Sen. Rick Scott, a consistent ally of Florida Power & Light, was governor of Florida and maintained warm ties with him. Matrix records show the firm paid the site at least $180,000. It shuttered a year after he won election to the U.S. Senate. A former Scott aide also founded The Capitolist, based in Tallahassee., Additionally, Matrix's clients took a strong interest in who wrote the laws and enforced the regulations. Last year, Florida Power & Light wrote a bill that was passed by the Florida Legislature and that would have gutted the ability of homeowners to make money off solar panels. Gov. Ron DeSantis ultimately vetoed it., One state away, Alabama Power runs and owns a coal-fired power plant that is the largest single source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States., An analysis by Floodlight and NPR of the three Alabama news sites with links to Matrix finds overwhelmingly positive coverage of Alabama Power. The review looked at articles on each site that contained the phrase ""Alabama Power"" and found that the vast majority of pieces either were positive or appeared to mirror a news release by the utility., In interviews, two former reporters at the Alabama Political Reporter recounted episodes in which articles about Alabama Power received intense and unusual scrutiny from editors. In one case, the story was never published. Its proprietor denies any such influence on the site., Together, Alabama Power and Florida Power & Light keep the lights on for nearly 7.5 million businesses and households. Since consumers' payments contribute to much of the two utilities' profits, much of the money that the companies spend effectively derives from consumers' bills., Matrix founder Joe Perkins has long held an interest in the power of the media. As a doctoral student at the University of Alabama, he wrote his thesis about a specific quandary: How can journalists' choice of sources and anecdotes affect public sentiment?, ""When a minority opinion gains access to the news media repeatedly through various techniques to make its point, it may be perceived as more widespread and pervasive than it actually is,"" he wrote in his 73-page paper., He then put his research to use, building up Matrix., In the early days, Matrix quietly sought to influence decisions over matters like who was eligible to win contracts with the Alabama teachers pension fund. The firm eventually established a presence in 10 states., Stealth was a hallmark of the operation. Matrix employees often created shell companies to conduct transactions for clients., ""Invisibility is more powerful than celebrity,"" reads a plaque hanging in Matrix's Montgomery office., Perkins and Pitts, the CEO, were characterized by some as akin to father and son; Perkins promised to one day pass on the company. Pitts benefited from an ability to instill loyalty and fear in those who carried out his commands, according to multiple people who have worked with him. (Most Matrix associates refused to be interviewed on the record for this story, citing the influence the two men maintain in their professional circles.), It took the unraveling of Matrix to reveal the full extent of its influence., At the end of 2020, Pitts left Matrix to start his own rival consulting firm called Canopy Partners. Perkins sued, accusing Pitts of secretly engaging in work for a utility based in Juno Beach, Florida while at Matrix. That is where Florida Power & Light is headquartered., In litigation involving both men, Pitts alleged he quit Matrix over Perkins' ""unethical practices,"" including ""deploying phony groups and digital platforms to intimidate individuals as a method to influence public perception and litigation."", The Alabama Political Reporter and Yellowhammer News launched during the same week in 2011. They have consistently cheered Alabama Power through overwhelmingly positive news stories., Starting at least as far back as April 2013, Matrix paid $8,000 a month to the Alabama Political Reporter, according to internal Matrix records. Matrix also drew up a proposed website design for the publication in June 2015, according to prototypes obtained by Floodlight and NPR., Britt, Alabama Political Reporter's editor in chief, says he could not verify the specific Matrix payments. He mocks the authenticity of the prototype, while confirming that Matrix designed his website. Britt affirms he took money from the firm for advertising and acknowledges that Matrix also paid for reporters to do research for the firm, an atypical practice for newsrooms., ""We have to make money,"" Britt says., When Alabama Power CEO Mark Crosswhite announced his retirement last month, Alabama Political Reporter posted a story written by ""STAFF."" It reproduced the company's press release, verbatim., The links to Yellowhammer News are more convoluted. In 2014 — the year Terry Dunn lost his bid for reelection — he faced attacks in the online press, including in Yellowhammer News., Floodlight and NPR were able to document a complex stream of transactions between a nonprofit run by an Alabama Power contractor and a series of nonprofits linked to Matrix and Yellowhammer News., For example, Yellowhammer News runs the Facebook page of a nonprofit, the Alabama Free Market Alliance, which attacks renewable energy. That nonprofit received $100,000 in 2014 from the Alabama Power-linked group, federal tax records show. All the nonprofits were involved in work that furthered the interests of Alabama Power., ""Yellowhammer Multimedia has no relationship, financial or otherwise, with Alabama Political Reporter, Matrix LLC or Alabama Free Market Alliance,"" Yellowhammer News owner Allison Ross says. She did not respond to questions about the site's relationship with Alabama Power., Eric Silagy, the CEO of Florida Power & Light. Bob Self/Florida Times-Union hide caption, Eric Silagy, the CEO of Florida Power & Light., Florida has stood out as one of Matrix's biggest successes. The firm represented several of the state's largest corporations, including a major fertilizer and sugar company as well as Florida Power & Light., Documents obtained for this story show executives at Matrix and Florida Power & Light dictated some coverage at The Capitolist after a Matrix employee purchased an option to buy the publication in 2019 through a limited liability company., In May 2020, The Capitolist ran a story mocking a call by the Miami Herald for reader donations. The headline read: ""The Miami Herald has turned to begging to support their biased reporting and fear-mongering."", Emails obtained by Floodlight and NPR for this story show that Florida Power & Light CEO Eric Silagy had proposed the story to Matrix employees., ""I would think The Capitolist would have a field day with this one,"" Silagy wrote to Pitts on May 4, 2020. The story ran three days later. Silagy had also suggested a cartoon of a prominent Herald reporter, Mary Ellen Klas, ""with a tin cup on the street corner."" The Capitolist blasted to thousands of its email newsletter subscribers an edited image of Klas in which she holds a sign asking for ""Spare change for Fake News — Miami Herald reporter needs help."", Journalism relies on a currency of trust: trust that the information provided is fairly presented. Trust that there are no hidden ulterior motives driving those reports, even when news is presented with a point of view., ""If you are paid for copy, then you can't be fair,"" says Chuck Strouse, the former editor in chief of Miami New Times. ""You have to acknowledge and be upfront with your reader about what exactly is happening. I mean, that's just a cardinal rule of journalism."", The editors operating the Matrix-linked sites do not appear to be following those rules., For example, emails show that The Capitolist's editor-in-chief and publisher, Brian Burgess — once a top aide to Senator Scott back when Scott was Florida's governor — asked Matrix executives for permission to write a pro-solar energy story. The story was requested in May 2020 by one of The Capitolist's other sponsors — a public relations company., ""Sachs Media is asking me for coverage on this, but wanted to run it by you first,"" Burgess wrote to Abigail MacIver, the Matrix employee to whom the site was formally registered. ""Need guidance on this ASAP."", Sachs Media's founder, Ron Sachs, confirms that his firm had advertised in The Capitolist., Emails show the Matrix executives ultimately agreed to let Burgess write the story because, as MacIver wrote, ""it makes him look like he's not in our pocket and it isn't bad for"" Florida Power & Light. (The executives were among those Matrix later sued.), ""The Capitolist stands by the accuracy of every story it has published and openly acknowledges that we bring a center-right, pro-free market editorial viewpoint to our work,"" Burgess writes in response to questions from NPR and Floodlight., Of all the leaders of sites with links to Matrix, only one, Florida Politics Publisher Peter Schorsch, acknowledges he doesn't observe traditional journalistic practices when deciding what to cover., Florida Politics Publisher Peter Schorsch. Allison Lynn Photography hide caption, Florida Politics Publisher Peter Schorsch., In an interview, Schorsch says he practices ""combination journalism"": He says Florida Politics' coverage is not dictated by advertisers, but it often gives them favorable coverage. And, he says, sometimes he gives them more coverage., ""Once a relationship is developed, if they come to us with the pitch [to cover a story], yes, they are going to be at the front of the daily line as opposed to a national advertiser making a pitch who I've never dealt with before,"" Schorsch says. ""I will say there's a very big wall in our operations"" between advertisers and coverage., A 2021 invoice shared by Schorsch shows that Florida Power & Light paid the site $43,000 for advertising, enough to cover the cost of a full-time reporter. Schorsch says his reporters do private research for clients too, though he would not specify what that entailed., By his own account, Schorsch also was paid roughly $100,000 by Apryl Marie Fogel, the publisher of Alabama Today, another of the Matrix-linked sites. The money went for help with ""editorial and digital tech services,"" he tells NPR and Floodlight. Fogel, who is also former Matrix CEO Pitts' romantic partner, received more than $140,000 from Matrix, the firm's records show. (She declines to comment on her ties to Matrix, saying ""not my monkeys, not my circus.""), Schorsch calls Fogel a friend and says he did not know she was being paid by Matrix., Ryan Ray, a Florida Politics reporter from 2014 to 2017, says Schorsch directed him to write favorably about industries that advertised with Florida Politics., ""There is no question that polluters, big special interests and others who have an interest in influencing Florida state government have paid Peter Schorsch for positive coverage or to avoid coverage,"" Ray tells Floodlight and NPR. ""I think even he would tell you that."", Schorsch rejects that allegation., ""I don't think there's been any thumb on the scale,"" Schorsch says. And he defends his model of journalism., ""I'm not trying to pretend that I'm an angel or anything like that,"" Schorsch says. ""But ... man. If I go, there's nothing left in this f***ing space. There's like the Tampa Bay Times, the Miami Herald, and you're down to nothing."", Terry Dunn left Montgomery, Ala., for good after he lost his reelection bid in 2014. Joe Songer for Floodlight hide caption, Terry Dunn left Montgomery, Ala., for good after he lost his reelection bid in 2014., As for Terry Dunn, he now lives more than two hours' drive from Montgomery, Alabama's capital. He left the city for good after he lost his reelection bid in 2014., ""Seeing how dirty everything was, [it's] basically just a cesspool down there,"" Dunn says. ""I was glad to get out."", Despite believing Alabama Power sent Matrix to drag him down, Dunn has trouble separating those who created corporate propaganda from the people who swallowed it — and voted him out of office. He knows that Alabama residents' electricity rates are not appreciably better today than they were before his election. These days, what fight he had has been displaced by resentment., ""Alabamians bitched about high power bills, but when they had someone that would address it, they abandoned me,"" Dunn says. ""So let them struggle to keep the lights on.""",Media

Laura Sullivan/NPR hide caption, Plastic covers the ground in a neighborhood in Indonesia. The country has battled the dumping of U.S. plastic recycling for years across its once pristine islands and waterways., For many, recycling feels like a tangible way to personally combat climate change and to positively affect the environment. That's partially because of decades of public environmental campaigns, advertisements and even school education aimed at increasing recycling., But the reality is that only a small fraction of plastic is ultimately recycled., A recent Greenpeace report found that people may be putting plastic into recycling bins — but the amount of plastic transformed into new items in the U.S. is at a new roughly 5-6% low., The plastic industry has spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the benefits of plastic, a product that, for the most part, was buried, was burned or, in some cases, wound up in the ocean. The problem has existed for decades. In all that time, less than 10 percent of plastic has ever been recycled., Meanwhile, plastic production is ramping up., New plastic is cheap. It's made from oil and gas, and it's almost always less expensive and higher quality. The result is that plastic trash has few markets — a reality the public has not wanted to hear., This episode was produced by Rebecca Ramirez, edited by Gisele Grayson and fact-checked by Abē Levine.",Short Wave

Scientists say the situation can teach us how to prepare for a drier, hotter future as the earth continues to warm. Elizabeth Rembert of Harvest Public Media reports from Nebraska. I'm walking through the Platte River right now to get to a sandbar that's right next to a bridge. You can hear the cars passing overhead. The reason I'm able to walk right now in the Platte is because there's just a couple of inches of water in the river. It's so shallow that I actually saw some guys driving their pickup truck in the riverbed. Even so, the fact that there's any water in the Platte is a little bit unusual. For the past few months, parts of the river have been bone-dry. Every time I do drive across the Platte, you just see the dryness. That's Liz Elliott. She works for the city of Lincoln, which relies on the Platte for some of its water. You just kind of hold your breath a little bit. She's part of a team searching for another water source as the world gets drier and hotter. We know to make sure that we have water for the next hundred years that we need to find a second source of water. Thinking far ahead is a good idea, according to the National Drought Mitigation Center. In the coming decades, higher temperatures and lower rainfall will mean more dry years. Downpours will be intense and short, and the sunbaked soil won't be able to take in the moisture. Nick Jordan is an ecologist at the University of Minnesota. That is going to substantially limit the ability of this part of the world to function as one of the major, quote-unquote, ""breadbasket regions."" He says U.S. agriculture is going to have to change significantly to find its place in a drier future. It could mean fewer corn and soybean fields. They have to be planted every year and take a lot of water. We have to move away from that, or we're going to have a food system that's really vulnerable to the variable weather that we expect to have. So instead of corn flakes, we may be eating something else, like Kernza flakes. Kernza is a perennial grain which Jordan says could do better in future droughts. It doesn't have to be planted every year, and its deep roots can track down water. But the economy would have to change a lot for farmers to opt for perennials over good old reliable corn. It's in candy bars, antibiotics, gasoline. And corn isn't the only thing that takes a lot of water. One pound of beef costs 40 bathtubs. Enter lab-grown meat. Emma Ignaszewski researches alternative proteins with the Good Food Institute. Communities have been forced to adapt to increasing droughts, floods, fires and crop failures, all while the demand for meat is set to double by 2050. She says meat that's grown in a lab can still get people their protein fix without relying on Mother Nature. Dry ground can also hurt people by making its way into their lungs through dust storms like this one, which hit western Kansas earlier this fall. Jesse Bell studies climate and health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. He says air pollution from dust storms and wildfires could cause serious problems for people with asthma or increase heat-related deaths. Drought changes the environment, and that change in the environment can lead to human health outcomes. He says it's a good time to start preparing for how a future with less water and hotter days will change our lives. For NPR News, I'm Elizabeth Rembert. ",Climate

The Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act allocated $170 million to tribal areas that are affected. Reporter Emily Schwing visited one community to find out how this infusion of federal cash might help. Dora Mathew is the environmental threat coordinator for the tribe in Chefornak. It's a small village of about 500 people in western Alaska. During a tour, Matthew stops by Ben Flynn's house. She calls through a window with a giant crack down the middle. Interview you at 4? Interview you at 4? Mathew sets up an interview for me. Four o'clock. OK.And then she shows me how the house is sliding backwards. It sits above a riverbank that's eroding because the ground underneath used to be frozen, and now it's thawing.So it's like the whole house is moving that way towards the river. Yeah, and it will slide down soon. Oh, wild.The beams that support the house are tilted at a precarious angle. See that whole - the railing and to the porch… Oh, yeah. It's, like, separated. Now it's open. There's an 18-inch gap between homeowner Ben Flynn's front porch and his house. And I keep adding plywood under my store doorstep. One kid fell on that crack. That kid is one of his five grandchildren, who also live here. His grandchild is fine. But inside, the cracked windows are a reminder that the three-bedroom house is becoming more and more unsafe.So it's you and your wife, two daughters and two sons. Two daughters and two sons. That's six. And then who else? And there's five grandchildren. And five grandchildren. So that's 11 people. Yeah. Chefornak, like most villages in Alaska, is dealing with a severe housing shortage that's further complicated by the effects of climate change. And if people get displaced, we don't have hotels. We don't have any vacant buildings we can put people in. Janet Erik is the president of the Traditional Council in Chefornak. Her community recently received $3.4 million from the federal government to tackle climate displacement. The housing crisis here is also playing out in at least 100 other Alaska Native villages. But not all of them have received funding through the Biden administration's branch of tribal climate resilience. Chefornak aims to build 19 new, safer homes, but Erik says the federal money isn't enough. I'm happy for the start. At the same time, it irritates me that it's just enough for a start because the start means one season or just a couple of months. And then we have to halt everything and go begging again. Some of the federal funding will help Chefornak's Tribal Council create a position to coordinate the work the rest of the money will pay for. The majority will purchase heavy equipment and build out a flat spot of ground for a single house. There's another home in Chefornak that sits at the bottom of a hill. (Non-English language spoken). He says come in. Oh, come in. OK.I've never seen a house where the tilt of the floor is so severe. It's like the bottom of a boat, almost. Yeah. (Non-English language spoken). Jobe Abraham, who's in his 80s, can understand English. But he likes to speak his Indigenous language, Yugtun. So Dora Mathew translates. He says his house has been sinking for years because the permafrost underneath is melting. (Non-English language spoken). He's not comfortable with his situation. Yeah. But he has to. And he's stuck. He's stuck. The $3.4 million coming to Chefornak is only a fraction of what's needed to move residents to safer ground. Some estimates show it would take tens of millions of dollars to do it right in this village.

Of that percentage, medium and heavy duty trucks — everything from delivery vans to big rigs –- make up 26% according to an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions by the EPA. Ian Mcdonnell/Getty Images hide caption, Truck manufacturers and an industry trade group privately lobbied to weaken U.S. climate policies while publicly promoting zero-emissions trucks, according to a new report from a think tank that tracks corporate influence on climate policy., Climate watchdog InfluenceMap found trade group the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) and companies Volvo, Daimler Truck, Volkswagen (Navistar), and PACCAR opposed climate policy on the federal and the state level while publicly promoting zero-emissions fleets., Nationally, truck manufacturers lobbied against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from heavy-duty truck models. The agency started phasing in new compliance and emissions standards in 2011. It's now developing new greenhouse gas requirements for heavy-duty engines and trucks that would be applied to model year 2030 trucks., At the state level, the EMA led a lobbying campaign in several states to oppose the adoption of the Advanced Clean Truck rule (ACT), which originated in California. The rule gradually increases the percentage of electric truck sales over the coming years. California, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have adopted the ACT., The transportation sector makes up 27% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Of that percentage, medium and heavy duty trucks — everything from delivery vans to big rigs — make up 26% according to an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions by the EPA., In November, the U.S. signed a non-binding global agreement committing to 100% new zero-emission medium and heavy-duty sales by 2040., InfluenceMap found that while manufacturers privately oppose ambitious climate rules, they publicly promote zero-emissions fleets. The organization's report notes that Ford Motor and General Motors disclosed ""less on climate policy than the other EMA truck makers analyzed."", Findings showed Ford and GM did not join an EMA lawsuit against the California Air Resources Board that would delay emissions from heavy-duty trucks. The two companies were the only ones analyzed in the report that did not join Partners for a Zero Emission Vehicle Future. That's a coalition of truck manufacturers, retailers, and trucking associations that opposes what it calls ""a patchwork"" of state regulations for getting to zero emissions., InfluenceMap analyst Kalina Dmitriew wrote the report based in part on previously unseen lobbying documents, including private emails and letters received through 33 public records requests across 11 states., Dmitriew says she knew lobbying was taking place but the ""sheer scale"" and the extent of it was surprising. She says such an endeavor ""really appears to be a strategic, and coordinated effort across multiple U.S. states."", InfluenceMap's report identified the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association as spearheading lobbying efforts especially on ACT rules., In an email, EMA President Jed Mandel wrote that his group is ""committed to a zero-emissions future for the U.S. trucking industry, which is why manufacturers are investing billions of dollars, developing groundbreaking zero-emission technologies and commercial vehicles, and working to ensure that federal and state regulations are workable and effective."", Truck manufacturers are responding to regulatory demands. Federal policy requires the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from diesel vehicles. States that have adopted the ACT rule require manufacturers to build zero-emissions trucks., Patricio Portillo, a senior advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says the report shows some truck manufacturers can't be trusted. ""The hypocrisy is frankly pretty outrageous,"" he says., ""What's unfortunate about this is that state and federal policymakers really look to (truck manufacturers) as valued stakeholders with important input,"" Portillo says., Maine and Colorado have delayed adopting versions of California's ACT rule, and Portillo believes lobbying from truck manufacturers played a role., ""Rather than spending those millions to oppose clean truck rules, they should be investing (in) them,"" Portillo says. ""Build the manufacturing and supply chains that are actually needed to get these vehicles to market into fleets and into these states that want to see the big significant benefits that can accrue from this rule."", Portillo says the regulations are not just good for the climate, but for local air quality. Medium and heavy duty trucks, he says, pass more frequently through low-income communities and communities of color, generating pollution., Bob Ramorino is president of Roadstar Trucking in Hayward, California, and he wants to add electric trucks to his fleet of about 25 vehicles. He thinks the new regulations at the federal and state levels are challenging for truck makers to address at the same time., ""They have got to meet the challenge,"" Ramorino says, yet ""they've got to remain profitable."", For Carlos Morales, who owns and operates a tractor-trailer in Richmond, California, stricter standards in the state could force him to leave the industry he's been a part of since 2003. Over the years Morales has upgraded his vehicle and bought new ones to meet changing emissions requirements., ""This may be my last truck,"" he says in Spanish. ""The laws are very strict and really impact us."" Morales says he's concerned he won't be able to buy an electric vehicle when the time comes.",Climate

It's a conference of parties — more than 190 countries in total (though, notably, not the U.S.) — gathered with the intent of slowing the decline in nature., This is the 15th meeting of the CBD. A critical one that's long-overdue. Previous planned conventions were disrupted by COVID-19, the kind of pandemic that scientists say becomes more likely as we continue to fracture and damage the natural world., What's so special about this one?, Every ten years, the CBD negotiates something called a Global Biodiversity Framework. It sets goals for member nations over the next decade. In this case, countries will try to agree on a framework that lasts until 2030., What are the main goals of this convention?, Generally and bluntly speaking, the main goal is to stop the bleeding., A study published last year suggests just 3% of the world's ecosystems are still ecologically intact — meaning they still support healthy populations of their native species and haven't been tarnished by human actions., The assessment, which was bleaker than previous studies, recommends urgent efforts to protect those areas and restore others, ""while this is still possible."", A report from the world's leading scientists shows humans have significantly altered 75% of the Earth's land and two-thirds of its oceans., ""Fundamentally, we need to safeguard our life support systems in the face of accelerating nature loss,"" said Rebecca Shaw, chief scientist at the World Wildlife Fund. ""Inaction is absolutely not an option because it will put us only at greater risks of pandemics, which none of us want, it undermines our efforts on securing our climate, and it makes our food production systems much more vulnerable."", Ok, but what specifically are they looking at?, The draft framework for the convention lists more than 20 goals (you can read it here)., The flashiest item on the list is a pledge by member countries to protect 30% of their land and water by the year 2030, a concept known as 30 by 30. The Biden administration has pledged to do that in the U.S., as have scores of other countries., An aerial view of a deforested area of the Amazonia rainforest in Brazil this year. SMichael Dantas/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, An aerial view of a deforested area of the Amazonia rainforest in Brazil this year., Big questions remain though about what, specifically, will count as conserved or protected land. And there are concerns from indigenous groups that the concept could be used as a pretense to displace indigenous people from their lands, similar to how the U.S. national park system was used to displace Native Americans., ""There is a lot of evidence that shows traditional lands and territories managed by indigenous peoples are the most important areas when it comes to biodiversity,"" said Viviana Figueroa, a legal expert at the International Indigenous Forum on Biodiversity, who's part of the negotiations in Montreal. ""So it would be a high interest to take our land. This is something we don't want."", Wait... why isn't the U.S. part of the Convention on Biological Diversity?, The U.S. is one of just four U.N. members that hasn't signed on to the CBD. The reason is politics., The CBD was ratified in 1993, with input from the U.S. The Clinton administration wanted to sign the treaty but was blocked by a Republican majority in the Senate., Conservation groups have called on the Biden administration to join the CBD. It rejoined the Paris climate agreement after the U.S. left under former president Donald Trump., The Biden administration has not made an effort to sign on to the treaty but is expected to have a behind-the-scenes role in the negotiations. It has made biodiversity a priority, appointing a first-ever special envoy for biodiversity and water resources, launching its America the Beautiful initiative, aimed at conserving and restoring natural ecosystems, and has started work on making nature a part of the country's economic calculus., What are the expected tension points?, As we saw at last month's climate conference in Egypt, these conventions often end without interested parties getting everything they want. Delegates expect there to be hard negotiations over the wording and substance of all the proposed goals., Similar to the climate conference, the biggest tension point is likely to revolve around the issue of financing. Conserving nature may be crucial to sustaining the global economy in the long-term, but it also costs money up front., Smaller, developing nations, which are disproportionately suffering the effects of climate change and biodiversity loss, want to see stronger financial commitments from richer, developed countries, which have economically benefited from polluting the world's environment., Richer countries have a long history of promising to help finance climate and biodiversity projects but haven't always followed through. Progress was made with the establishment of a fund for ""loss and damage"" — the climate impacts smaller countries are feeling right now — at the recent climate conference but questions remain about who will put money into it and when., The first draft of the biodiversity framework identified a $700 billion annual financing gap to reverse nature's decline. Questions will undoubtedly come up over who should help pay to resolve that., Will an agreement actually slow nature loss?, That is the many dollar question. And there's reason for skepticism. The previous ten-year framework set by the CBD in 2010 established 20 conservation and nature-related targets for the year 2020. None of them were achieved., More than 10,000 people are attending this year's CBD, including NGOs and businesses., Shaw said the broad interest from the public and private sector is a hopeful indication that the biodiversity crisis is finally gaining broad international recognition., ""We have seen a ratcheting up in commitment and focus on climate change in the last 20 years,"" Shaw said. ""And it's because the impacts have become unbearable globally. Like you can't ignore it anymore. We're there on the nature side."", Now, she said, it's time to act.",Environment

More than a million species are at risk of of extinction, many within decades, because of human actions. This week, delegates from around the world are gathering in Canada to try to come up with a plan to slow that decline.To talk about this Convention on Biological Diversity, we are joined by NPR's Nathan Rott. Hey, Nate. Hey, Mary Louise. Set the stage for me a little bit more here. What exactly is happening this week in Canada? OK. So you remember that climate conference just a few weeks ago in Egypt, COP27? This is basically the biodiversity - the nature equivalent to that. Delegates from more than 190 countries are all going to try to get together to try to approve a global plan to save the natural world. A global plan to save the natural world - just a small mission there. Yeah, small potatoes. You know, it's easy to think about biodiversity when we're talking about it as just being cute, furry critters, right? - the polar bear at risk from declining sea ice. But when we're talking about biodiversity, really, we're talking about so much more here. The science is extremely clear on this. Healthy, intact nature is essential to pretty much every part of the human experience. You know, trees and plankton make the oxygen we breathe. Wetlands clean the water we drink. Peatlands store climate-warming carbon. Biodiversity feeds us. It pays the bills. Here's Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Fifty percent of the global GDP - our economy - depends on biodiversity. And yet we human beings - we have distorted that biodiversity in nature by 97% globally. So she says the main goal of this convention is to basically balance the scales, to come out of this with a roadmap for fixing that relationship with nature. What kind of a roadmap? What might it look like? So there's a draft that we've been able to see. It has 22 specific goals. Probably the flashiest goal in that is a pledge to conserve 30% of the Earth's land and water by the year 2030. It's also known as 30 by 30. The Biden administration is taking steps already to do this here in the U.S., but what that looks like globally is still a really big question. There are concerns in some parts of the world that this could enable countries to displace Indigenous people by declaring a place conserved, which, remember, Mary Louise, is basically what happened with national parks here in the U.S.Scientists say humans have significantly altered 75% of the Earth's land and two-thirds of the oceans. And a study published last year, which was far bleaker, suggested only 3%, just 3% of the world's natural places are still ecologically intact. So obviously, there's a huge need to protect areas. But remember, this is a convention of more than 190 countries who will all have to agree on a path forward. And as we saw at the climate conference last month, there's going to be disagreements about what that actually looks like. Well, and having just interviewed you when you were at that climate conference in Egypt, it was very clear. It's one thing to set goals. It's another to keep them, to do them. Is that... Yeah. ...The concern here as well? It most definitely is. You know, we've had 27 climate conferences. And climate warming emissions are still on the rise. The same is very true here. The last big framework on biodiversity, like the one they're doing now, set 20 goals to achieve for the year 2020. They did not achieve any of them. And given the rate of extinction we're seeing, the climate disasters like flooding, fires and droughts, you know, there's a real sense that this framework needs to not only be ambitious, it needs to be achieved. That is Nathan Rott from NPR's climate desk. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. ",Climate

Lightning tends to strike the biggest trees – which, in tropical forests, lock away a huge share of the planet's carbon. As those trees die and decay, the carbon leaks into the atmosphere and contributes to global warming., Gora works with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, in collaboration with canopy ecologist Steve Yanoviak, quantitative ecologist Helene Muller-Landau, and atmospheric physicists Phillip Bitzer and Jeff Burchfield., On today's episode, Evan Gora tells Aaron Scott about a few of his shocking discoveries in lightning research, and why Evan says he's developed a healthy respect for the hazards it poses – both to individual researchers and to the forests that life on Earth depends on., This episode was produced by Devan Schwartz with help from Thomas Lu, edited by Gabriel Spitzer and fact-checked by Brit Hanson.",Short Wave

Natural gas is in the way,Michael Copley,"To close America's remaining coal plants, many industry analysts believe the country needs natural gas to ensure reliable energy supplies until cleaner options like battery storage are widely available. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption, To close America's remaining coal plants, many industry analysts believe the country needs natural gas to ensure reliable energy supplies until cleaner options like battery storage are widely available., Under President Joe Biden, the United States aims to cut all carbon pollution by 2035 from the power plants that run American homes and businesses. It's a first step toward the broader goal of zeroing out greenhouse gas emissions across the entire economy by midcentury to rein in climate change., But the ambitions of the Biden administration are set to collide with the country's power industry, which looks like it will continue burning fossil fuels for the foreseeable future., Over the next few years, the U.S. is expected to build around 17 gigawatts of natural gas plants, enough to power close to 12.8 million homes, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Unless they're closed early, those plants could operate for decades on an electric grid that still gets almost 60% of its power from fossil fuels., Natural gas creates fewer emissions than coal when it's burned, but producing and transporting gas releases huge amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Most remaining oil and gas deposits must remain buried for the world to have a decent shot at keeping global temperatures from rising to more dangerous levels, according to a study last year in the journal Nature., But analysts don't expect the U.S. will end its reliance on natural gas any time soon. To close America's remaining coal plants, which generate around a fifth its electricity, many industry analysts believe the country needs natural gas to ensure reliable energy supplies until cleaner options like battery storage are widely available., ""If you're going to kick that 20% of coal off the grid by 2030 or 2035, there is zero chance you can do that without increasing gas,"" says Andy DeVries, an analyst at CreditSights who tracks companies in the U.S. power industry. ""After the coal's off the grid, how much longer does it take to then kick the gas off? That's at least another 10 years,"" DeVries says. ""And that's aggressive."", Scientists say the incremental cuts that countries are making to emissions won't be enough to avoid a future that brings more damaging storms, floods and heat waves. The U.S. has a giant pipeline of renewable energy projects — 45 gigawatts of solar and wind are expected to be built next year alone — but continuing to add emissions from new fossil fuel plants makes it harder to limit global warming., ""The consensus is that we need to be at net zero greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by about 2050 in order to avert the worst impacts of climate change,"" says Ben King, an associate director at the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Continuing to build natural gas plants ""certainly seems at loggerheads with that commitment,"" he says., Utility companies say they can zero out greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to rely on natural gas plants like this one in California. Mario Tama/Getty Images hide caption, Utility companies say they can zero out greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to rely on natural gas plants like this one in California., One of America's new natural gas plants is being built in Alabama by a subsidiary of Southern Company, a vast utility with millions of customers in the Southeast. Alabama regulators signed off on the project in 2020, shortly after Southern announced plans to eliminate or offset its greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury., Southern set its climate target after facing pressure from big investors to come up with a strategy to manage the risks from global warming and to capitalize on growing demand for clean energy. The company gets 70% of its energy from fossil fuels, and the net-zero pledge was applauded by activists and investors. In a statement praising Southern, the manager of New York City's public pension funds at the time said cutting carbon emissions ""is not just a moral imperative, it's a financial necessity."", But that doesn't mean Southern's walking away from fossil fuels., Once it's up and running, the company's new gas plant in Alabama is expected to operate until the 2060s — well past the point when Southern has said it will achieve net zero emissions. And more natural gas looks to be on the way. Southern's subsidiary in Alabama has said it expects to be making gas investments into the 2040s., A Southern spokesperson said the company is ""committed to reducing our [greenhouse gas] emissions to provide our customers and communities a clean energy future."" The spokesperson pointed to recent comments by Southern's CEO, Thomas Fanning, in which Fanning said natural gas ""must remain a solution"" for America's energy needs., ""People that say, somehow, hydrocarbons are gonna go away and we don't need them, I think, are sorely mistaken,"" Fanning said at an energy conference in September. To deal with heat-trapping pollution, Fanning said that by 2050, ""all existing, or almost all existing"" natural gas plants the company owns will be outfitted with technology to capture carbon emissions. He said hydrogen could also be used to cut emissions., Other utilities that rely heavily on fossil fuels are making similar bets., Duke Energy, which has said it will achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, is building a natural gas plant in North Carolina that it says will also be able to burn hydrogen. A Duke spokesperson called natural gas a ""bridge fuel"" that will allow the company to close its coal plants. A spokesperson for Dominion Energy, which plans to eliminate or offset its carbon and methane emissions by midcentury, says a gas plant the company is building in South Carolina will probably only be used for short periods of time when electricity demand is highest., Both companies are looking to carbon capture technology, which keeps emissions from being released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned, to help achieve their climate goals. And they recently joined a group of utilities that want to build hydrogen projects across the southeastern U.S., However, carbon capture technology is expensive and has often performed worse than expected. And hydrogen poses challenges that could be hard to overcome, analysts say, including potentially weakening pipelines that transport it., ""There is no reason to take any utility's net-zero commitment seriously, especially if they are investing in anything that emits new CO2 or has any new emissions,"" says Daniel Tait, a research and communication manager at the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group that advocates for renewable energy., Climate change is making storms like Hurricane Ian that slammed into Florida in September wetter and more powerful. Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption, Climate change is making storms like Hurricane Ian that slammed into Florida in September wetter and more powerful., At the slow pace countries are cutting emissions, warming is on track to set off runaway impacts that could lead to permanent changes in the Earth's ecosystems, such as the widespread death of coral reefs., ""The more that we accelerate and keep putting greenhouse gasses into the climate now, the more we have a chance of reaching tipping points in the Earth's system,"" says Lisa Dilling, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""If you start to get to these tipping points, our climate starts to change in ways that are possibly irreversible, possibly self-perpetuating."", At the recent United Nations climate conference in Egypt, countries said they're still committed to keeping average global temperatures from rising by more than than 1.5 degrees Celsius (about 2.8 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to the pre-industrial era of the 1800s. If the world gets hotter than that, scientists say catastrophic impacts are more likely to happen. But it isn't clear how that goal will be achieved. The vast majority of heat-trapping pollution comes from humans using oil, gas and coal, but several countries blocked language about phasing down fossil fuel use from being included in the talks' final agreement., ""We need to rapidly plan out the phase down and phase out of coal, oil and gas, especially in rich, large countries,"" Manish Bapna, CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in Egypt., The problem, according to industry analysts, is that power companies don't see better options than natural gas right now. Batteries are getting a lot of attention, but the heads of big utility companies aren't ""entirely confident"" that they're ready yet to back up all of the intermittent wind and solar power that's being added to the grid, says Ryan Sweezey, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm., ""I don't think [people] quite understand how unprecedented, how monumentally challenging the task is to essentially remake the energy system,"" Sweezey says. Net zero emissions probably won't happen by 2050, he says, ""just given the scale of the challenges involved."", The question is whether the U.S. could move faster. And a lot of experts think the recently-passed Inflation Reduction Act could help to do just that. The law provides billions of dollars of incentives that are expected to make renewable energy even more competitive with fossil fuels. And the war in Ukraine has driven up natural gas prices, changing how some investors are approaching the energy market, says King of the Rhodium Group., ""Developers are taking a second look at natural gas and saying, 'Is this going to be a prudent, long-term investment, given both expected higher gas prices into the future as well as just how inexpensive it is to deploy technologies like wind and solar and batteries?"" King says., But change so far is happening gradually in energy markets, and companies are still making investments that will lead to new emissions., ""I think there's a long tail here,"" says Bank of America analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith, ""specifically tied to the use of natural gas.""",Climate

But companies that supply electricity to American homes and businesses aren't likely to stop using fossil fuels anytime soon. Michael Copley with NPR's climate desk has been following this closely. Michael, all right, you've been looking at what the power industry is doing around climate. Why'd you focus there? And what'd you find? Yeah. So I zeroed in on the power sector because it's going to be one of the easiest places to reduce emissions, relatively speaking. Renewables like wind and solar have gotten really inexpensive. And there's a lot of investment happening in big batteries that store energy. But what we're seeing is that companies are still building fossil fuel plants that are going to be around for decades. So companies are building enough natural gas plants to power close to 13 million homes. That's according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That means the natural gas plant that starts producing electricity next year could run into the 2060s. That's way beyond when the U.S. government and a lot of these same companies have said they'll zero out emissions.MARTÍ So it sounds like companies are saying one thing, then doing something else. You know, it's a complicated picture. One of the explanations that I heard is that big utility companies just don't think they have much of a choice right now. They're under pressure to retire coal plants. They're having to deal with a lot of intermittent wind and solar. And they need some way to make sure that they have energy whenever they need it. And right now, they just don't see a cleaner option to do that than natural gas. That's one explanation.Another is that these utilities just don't face much scrutiny from their state regulators. And so they're not under pressure to change the types of investments that they're making. And they know that they can make a lot of money building natural gas plants. Andy DeVries is an analyst at CreditSights who covers the power market. He said the reality is probably somewhere in the middle. Yes, of course, these utilities want to overspend on everything. But they do have a good point. The lights do have to stay on. And when that solar goes down and when that wind's not running, you need these gas plants. Now, DeVries says that as long as we're trying to retire coal, gas is probably going to still be part of the picture.MARTÍ All right. So if some of these companies feel like they have to keep investing in fossil fuels, I mean, how realistic then are climate targets for them? You know, the companies that I talked to said they can do both things at once. Now, what they're counting on is technology to either capture the emissions before they're released into the atmosphere or some other fuel, like hydrogen, that they can use to replace natural gas in these power plants that they're building. But that assumes those technologies are going to work and be cost effective. And that could be years away.MARTÍ All right. So then what does that mean for our efforts to reign in climate change? It's going to be harder. The Earth's going to keep getting hotter as we keep pumping out more emissions. And that worries scientists like Lisa Dilling at the University of Colorado, Boulder. She says the risk is that we hit climate tipping points. These are points of no return that could lead to permanent changes in the Earth's ecosystems, like melting glaciers or the widespread death of coral reefs. If you start to get to these tipping points, our climate starts to change in ways that are possibly irreversible, possibly self-perpetuating and start to threaten the basic ways that we've organized our society. Dilling says that could mean everything from how we grow food to where we live.MARTÍ All right. So scientists say we have to move faster to cut emissions. What's the chance that that will ever happen? Look, there's a ton of excitement around the Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats passed earlier this year, provides billions of dollars of incentives that are expected to make renewable energy a lot more competitive with fossil fuels. At the same time, analysts say that high natural gas prices from the war in Ukraine are starting to change how some investors think about the types of investments they make in energy markets. That said, changes historically happened pretty slowly in energy markets. And companies are still putting money into power plants that are going to generate new emissions.MARTÍ That's Michael Copley with NPR's climate desk.Michael, thanks. Thanks, A. ",Energy

Scientists say a million living species are threatened, and many could go extinct within decades. So diplomats and advocates are trying to see if they can come to an agreement about the poaching, pollution, farming and ranching methods and other practices that destroy habitats and endanger so many forms of life. Elizabeth Maruma Mrema is the executive secretary of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, and she is with us now. Madam Secretary, thank you so much for being with us. Pleasure. Thank you very much for having me. So when biologists talk about mass extinction, as briefly as you can, could you just help us understand what that would look like? I think the easiest way to understand is biodiversity as a foundation of life. It is because the food we eat, the water we drink, the carbon storage needed for climate mitigation, the water regulation needed for climate adaptation, the livelihoods, the medicines we need all come from biodiversity and ecosystem services it provides. As if that is not important, 50% of the global GDP - our economy - depends on biodiversity. So clearly, the main goal of the conference upcoming is to emerge with a road map for repairing our relationship with that biodiversity nature because we, human beings, are the major culprits of the loss of biodiversity. Our relationship with nature needs to change drastically if we are to get away from where scientists say we are almost to the tipping point and that this is our last chance. What I think I hear you saying is that this is not about one significant event. This is about human activities at this point - the way we mine, the way we farm, the way we travel... Yes. ...All of those things. When you mention species, it's not species plants and animals alone. It also include us human beings. It means we will perish just as the animals and plants will be. Do you have the sense - forgive me, Madam Secretary, but I get the sense that the question of biodiversity, in your view, has, in a way, become like the poor cousin to the climate change conversation. Yes. Do you think that that's so? I get the sense of urgency and perhaps a bit of frustration on your part that biodiversity hasn't gotten the same level of high-level attention and commitment as the climate issue writ large. Do you think that that's true? And why do you think that is? It was true. It is no longer true. For a long time, the world had paid attention to climate change, forgetting that we cannot deal with climate change without dealing with biodiversity loss. Now the world has realized that these two issues are intrinsically connected and linked and that they cannot deal with one without the other. Now we're also seeing this attention to biodiversity than ever before - so clearly indicate the trend has changed and the train is moving. Before we let you go, Madam Secretary, I mean, you have made the case very strongly that biodiversity isn't just about, you know, parks and, you know, walks in nature. But I cannot help but notice that, you know, you've practiced law all over the world, but you come from a part of the world, from Tanzania, that has amazing biodiversity. Is there something, a creature, that reminds you of where you grew up that could go extinct without some intervention? Indeed. I - as you have mentioned, I come from a country which is rich in biodiversity, particularly animals. But it is also sad that what I saw as I grew up is not what I'm seeing today. If we talk of species of elephants, rhinos, when you look at the forest, the trees, they continue to disappear because, particularly in the village where I come from and many other villages, firewood is the source of energy. And unless the villagers are given an alternative to firewood, the trees will continue to disappear. So even those slogans and campaign of cut a tree, plant a tree have not worked to its full potential. So this is what I have seen. Coming from the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, of course, the women have to fetch firewood because that's the source of energy. And that will continue the deforestation. As long as we are not yet able to deal with illegal trade, with poaching, species will continue to disappear. This is what we are seeing. And you've seen this just in your lifetime. Yes.

That's true in and around Lake Chad. The lake, once one of Africa's largest, has shrunk by some 90% over the last few decades. For people on what were or still are its banks in Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon, persistent drought is mixing with poverty, poor governance and the conflict in Ukraine making food prices higher to create a combustible set of circumstances. Willem Marx has this report. For more than three nights and days, Haoua Gawlou Moussa walked, swam and floated her way to safety. The Islamist group Boko Haram destroyed her home in western Chad and shattered her family's life. (Non-English language spoken). ""During the night while we were sleeping, at around 3 a.m., they set the village on fire,"" she says. ""Some people died. Some escaped. Some people escaped but left their children behind, like me. I left three of my children behind."" She lost sight of those children in the chaos and, despite desperate searching, never found them. She assumes they must be dead. Now, safe in her brother's village, she pulls together dinner for her remaining children from the little she has - water with flour and twigs for a fire. (Non-English language spoken). As meager as it is, Haoua's food supply is relatively secure. But for the thousands of residents living in a camp close to the waters of Lake Chad, life is more precarious. Like Haoua, they've also fled Boko Haram attacks on their homes in northern Nigeria. They must make do in tents, relying on occasional distributions from the United Nations World Food Program. Yagana Ali Abakar is struggling to make those supplies stretch among her family of nine. (Non-English language spoken). ""The food given to me is not enough to feed myself and my children,"" she says. ""I sell some of the basic food I am given to buy ingredients for soup. I've said I needed to do something to help myself and my children."" She owns almost nothing except cooking utensils she now uses far too rarely. She hopes to establish herself here as a seamstress with a rented sewing machine. But deep in debt since her last food handout several weeks ago, she takes her children door to door requesting charity from camp neighbors.She has no food today for her kids. Are there many people like that? A lot of people. Nasuri Saidu is a former fisherman. He used to fish in the shrinking waters of Lake Chad. Now he's also reliant on U.N. rations that were recently reduced due to funding shortfalls. Due to lack of food, you know, whatever you have, you'll be able to sell it and buy food for your children. U.N. supplies are only shared out every seven weeks, though Nasuri says some of the luckier camp residents who earn an income can buy food from makeshift markets. Across Chad, a vast expanse of scrubland on the south of the Sahara desert, the government's presence is limited. And besides United Nations and NGOs, the most visible authority in many towns is the country's military, one of the best armed and financed in the region. Chad's decades of on-off civil conflicts have calmed slightly in recent years, meaning the war against Boko Haram has become more central to the army's mission. But food shortages help the group recruit fresh fighters, according to Agassiz Baroum, a think tank director focused on the conflict. (Non-English language spoken). ""There is a connection between the insecurity caused by Boko Haram and food insecurity,"" he says. ""Because most people that we interviewed at Lake Chad made us understand that if they joined Boko Haram, it was in search of food."" And his field research has found that continued violence only exacerbates the problem. (Non-English language spoken). ""This is where the conflict has accelerated food insecurity,"" he says, ""because of the fact that Boko Haram carries out abuses, attacks, prevents the local population from going fishing, for example, from going to plough fields, all activities are on hold and that's the reason why we're seeing an increase in this food insecurity."" Back at the camp, former fisherman Nasuri says he is grateful for the small support he does receive.People here in Chad, are they welcoming? Are they helping you? They are welcoming, and they're helping us. But he's frustrated, too, after arriving here seven years ago. His children are now hungrier than ever before, he explains as he introduces his family. (Non-English language spoken). (Non-English language spoken). (Non-English language spoken). (Non-English language spoken).Laughter is rare on Chad's western border. Fear, uncertainty and empty stomachs are not. For NPR News, I'm Willem Marx in Dar es Salaam camp in western Chad. ",Africa

Sam McNeil/AP hide caption, A sea turtle swims over corals on Moore Reef in Gunggandji Sea Country off the coast of Queensland in eastern Australia on Nov. 13, 2022., CANBERRA, Australia — Australia's environment minister said Tuesday her government will lobby against UNESCO adding the Great Barrier Reef to a list of endangered World Heritage sites, arguing that criticisms of government inaction on climate change were outdated., Officials from the U.N. cultural agency and the International Union for Conservation of Nature released a report on Monday warning that without ""ambitious, rapid and sustained"" climate action, the world's largest coral reef is in peril., The report, which recommended shifting the Great Barrier Reef to endangered status, followed a 10-day mission in March to the famed reef system off Australia's northeast coast that was added to the World Heritage list in 1981., Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said the report was a reflection on Australia's previous conservative government, which was voted out of office in May elections after nine years in power., She said the new center-left Labor Party government has already addressed several of the report's concerns, including action on climate change., ""We'll very clearly make the point to UNESCO that there is no need to single the Great Barrier Reef out in this way"" with an endangered listing, Plibersek told reporters., ""The reason that UNESCO in the past has singled out a place as at risk is because they wanted to see greater government investment or greater government action and, since the change of government, both of those things have happened,"" she added., The new government has legislated to commit Australia to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 43% below the 2005 level by 2030., The previous government only committed to a reduction of 26% to 28% by the end of the decade., Plibersek said her government has also committed 1.2 billion Australian dollars ($798 million) to caring for the reef and has canceled the previous government's plans to build two major dams in Queensland state that would have affected the reef's water quality., ""If the Great Barrier Reef is in danger, then every coral reef in the world is in danger,"" Plibersek said. ""If this World Heritage site is in danger, then most World Heritage sites around the world are in danger from climate change."", The report said Australia's federal government and Queensland authorities should adopt more ambitious emission reduction targets in line with international efforts to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times., The minor Greens party, which wants Australia to slash its emissions by 75% by the end of the decade, called for the government to do more to fight climate change in light of the report., Jodie Rummer, a marine biologist at James Cook University in Townville who has worked on the reef for more than a decade, supported calls for Australia to aim for a 75% emissions reduction., ""We are taking action, but that action needs to be much more rapid and much more urgent,"" Rummer told Australian Broadcasting Corp., ""We cannot claim to be doing all we can for the reef at this point. We aren't. We need to be sending that message to the rest of the world that we are doing everything that we possibly can for the reef and that means we need to take urgent action on emissions immediately,"" she added., Feedback from Australian officials, both at the federal and state level, will be reviewed before Paris-based UNESCO makes any official proposal to the World Heritage committee., In July last year, the previous Australian government garnered enough international support to defer an attempt by UNESCO to downgrade the reef's status to ""in danger"" because of damage caused by climate change., The Great Barrier Reef accounts for around 10% of the world's coral reef ecosystems. The network of more than 2,500 reefs covers 348,000 square kilometers (134,000 square miles)., Australian government scientists reported in May that more than 90% of Great Barrier Reef coral surveyed in the latest year was bleached, in the fourth such mass event in seven years., Bleaching is caused by global warming, but this is the reef's first bleaching event during a La Niña weather pattern, which is associated with cooler Pacific Ocean temperatures, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Authority said in its annual report., Bleaching in 2016, 2017 and 2020 damaged two-thirds of the coral., Coral bleaches as a response to heat stress and scientists hope most of the coral will recover from the latest event.",Environment

The little town sits on the shore of Lake Powell, America's second-largest reservoir. And that's the town that built the Glen Canyon Dam. But the drought on the Colorado River is so bad that Page now faces a reckoning. From member station KUNC, here's Alex Hager. A storm sweeps across the red and white sandstone canyons carved by the Colorado River. On the edge of a cliff towering hundreds of feet above the water, Tobyn Pilot walks across a crunchy patch of red dirt and pulls out his keys. Pilot is with the city of Page's Water Department, and he's opening the door to a tiny but important wood-paneled shed. Here, water from the lake is pulled all the way up to the top of the cliff to serve the 7,000 people who live in Page. This is the town's water, comes right through the shack. (Laughter). Crazy to think. Page has always taken its water from Lake Powell, but now the reservoir is shrinking so fast, the pipe that used to be under hundreds of feet of water is in danger of popping above the water line. That would leave Page and a neighboring Navajo chapter dry. They never anticipated the lake actually dropping down to a level where they weren't going to be able to generate, or Page was going to struggle to get water. Page utility manager Bryan Hill's job is to keep taps flowing. And he's stuck with historic missteps, both recent and decades old. That just simply wasn't anticipated. That's why we're scrambling to make a design mod down there now. Design mod means reworking the pipes inside the dam. Right now, welders are putting together new pipes to connect a backup intake to Page. But Hill says Page won't have peace of mind until there's a second straw, a little further upstream that would provide redundancy. It's possible, but it won't come cheap. It's roughly a $46 million project. And as you can imagine, you're not going to get that kind of money out of 3,500 water customers. That's just not going to happen. Hill says the federal government should be on the hook for that help. After all, the city of Page is only here because workers building the dam in the 1950s needed somewhere to live. Hill says that means federal officials bear some responsibility for making sure the city has adequate water supply. The federal agency in charge of the dam says it's committed to working with the city of Page and offering assistance but hasn't yet drawn up plans to distribute the $4 billion it got from the Inflation Reduction Act. The new challenges in Page are a warning sign to Kathryn Sorensen. Climate change means that the flows of the Colorado River will continue to diminish. Sorensen is the former water department director for Phoenix, one of the big cities that draws heavily from the Colorado. Now she researches water policy at Arizona State University. And so for those communities that are dependent on Colorado River, they need to be looking around at their infrastructure, their alternative supplies and developing means to be able to continue safe, reliable deliveries at the tap. She's talking about roughly 40 million people there in places like Los Angeles and Denver. Sorensen says it's not just climate change putting city water supplies at risk. The water delivery system in the southwest is getting old. So I think you're going to see pressures from both sides. And I think that that might be really humbling for some of our communities. And whether the money comes from federal coffers or increased water rates, Sorensen says small towns and big cities alike will need to react quickly to steel their systems against climate change.

The history of its salty, therapeutic waters goes back to the Bible. But this natural wonder is rapidly drying up, even changing the land around it. NPR's Daniel Estrin recently took to the water to explore what is being lost and what it will take to prevent more destruction. The Dead Sea is magic. It is the lowest exposed place on Earth. It is 10 times saltier than the ocean. So you don't sink in it. You float. The mud and the waters are full of minerals - great therapeutic for your skin. But the Dead Sea is dying. The lake level is dropping 4 feet every single year. So we've taken this rare boat ride on the Dead Sea to see some of these changes. You're seeing a living disaster in front of your eyes, you know? And since the sea's receding so fast, you know, you see it. It's not that there's a change that you don't see. No, you see it. Jackie Ben Zaken (ph) has special Israeli permission to give boat tours here. After all, it's a border zone and shared with Jordan. It's hard for aquatic life to exist in the salty waters, hence the name, Dead Sea. You see this thing that sticks out there when you go up? Seven years ago, I used to tie my boat there. Seven years ago? Wow.He's pointing to a spot that's now dry land high above us. It's shocking to see, a 4-foot drop every single year. The cause is that in the last several decades, the freshwater sources that feed into the Dead Sea have been diverted for drinking water and irrigation. We are living in the Middle East, OK? So there's not a lot of water. Also, Israeli and Jordanian companies pump out and evaporate Dead Sea water to harvest its rich minerals for export. The salty sea is receding so quickly, it leaves behind stunning salt pillars along the shores.So it's beautiful, but it actually tells you that there's something not so beautiful happening. Of course. Of course. It's not the natural changes. It's the rapid changes that the environment can't adapt to. It's too fast, you know? You get a sense of how an entire landscape can change when a lake is dried up. Cavities along the shore open up into sinkholes.So we're just looking at - it looks like this huge crater that has just collapsed. That's a sinkhole. We stop at a beach that's been condemned because a sinkhole swallowed up the parking lot.Here are some abandoned beach chairs. Oh, here's a little mini barbecue set.Farmers have also abandoned their watermelon and basil farms along the shores. We will just walk down here. There is a very big sinkhole. Dead Sea researcher Yael Kiro from the Weizmann Institute of Science shows me a part of the main road alongside the Dead Sea that collapsed four years ago. Really, really careful. And maybe... Wow, wow, wow. Oh, my gosh. This road just sinks into itself. It's like the Earth has opened up and swallowed it. It breaks my heart. There's just so much destruction. This is just a direct result of the lake level drop. I don't know. It just makes me sad. Climate change makes this worse. The area is getting hotter. Rainfall is dropping. Populations are growing, and there's not enough water for drinking and irrigation, let alone for saving the Dead Sea. There are many proposals to rehabilitate the Dead Sea, like filling it with desalinated water from the Red Sea or rehabilitating the Jordan River - the Dead Sea's main water source - or trying to compel the companies mining the Dead Sea to help pay for its rehabilitation. But there's been no action. And this is so sad because the solutions is so not easy and very, very expensive now, unfortunately. Galit Cohen is the director general of the Israeli Environmental Protection Ministry. If you want to bring back water to the Dead Sea, it means desalination, water all around. And this is very, very expensive, of course. And not all the countries around us can pay for that amount of the money. Israel and Jordan are former enemies with chilly relations. They did recently sign a deal where Jordan will give Israel solar energy, and Israel will give desalinated drinking water to Jordan, which is parched. But there's still no action plan to save these biblical bodies of water they share, the Dead Sea and the Jordan River. King Abdullah of Jordan spoke about this at the U.N. climate change conference in Egypt. The Dead Sea and the sacred Jordan River are treasures of the past and legacies for our future. Our generation must not be the broken link. Along the shores, I meet Shay Rabineau of Binghamton University, who's hiking around the Dead Sea and writing a book about it. He just finished hiking the Jordan side. What we've heard is a lot of pessimism, right? People on the Jordanian side have said, our lives have gotten worse. It seems like most people are accepting that the level of this part of the sea may drop another 100 meters, 150 meters in the future. That could take over a hundred years. Some researchers are optimistic that as the Dead Sea level drops more and more, an urgency will grow to save it with desalinated water. The question is how long the natural wonder that's existed for millions of years will keep disappearing 4 feet a year.Daniel Estrin, NPR News, the Dead Sea. ",Climate

Michael Kaloki hide caption, This story was updated on December 9, 2022., We were a newly formed, hotel-freezer-trained African ice-carving team, applying to compete in the world-famous 2003 Quebec Winter Carnival. This was like applying to run the 100-meter race at the Summer Olympics, but never having tried on a pair of running shoes. But, it was worth a try. After all, there was a first time for Carl Lewis, too., I found the details online. ""We will figure it out as we go along,"" I remember telling my intrepid teammates. At the back of my mind, I thought it was a crazy, uncalculated move., But after several weeks, I received a response from the Carnival. Team Kenya had been accepted! We could not believe it! We were going to take part in a major global event!, Reaching this milestone was a combination of inspiration, generosity, perseverance and insanity. It's not that I hadn't seen snow before – I had. From our village in eastern Kenya, in the bright early morning you could look in one direction and see Mount Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania, and in the other see Mount Kenya, my country's pride and glory. I had often wondered what snow felt like and how lucky we were to be able to wake up and see it., The year before the Carnival, I had just returned to Kenya after finishing a radio and television arts degree course at a university in Toronto, where there was plenty of snow. I was not sure what I wanted to do with my life. ""You are spending too much time in the house, Michael,"" my dad would say., I also remember a headline from one of Kenya's daily newspapers that year: ""Climate Change Threatens the Snow and Ice Caps of Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya."" I was an adult now and understood what climate change meant., My country's name is even linked to snow and ice. The word ""Kenya"" is said to have come about when a German explorer, Johann Ludwig Krapf, asked local Chief Kivoi about a mountain he'd seen. Kivoi described the mountain as ""kiinya,"" in reference to it looking like an ostrich – with the snow resembling the white patches of the flightless bird. Now we were in danger of losing it., While studying in Canada, I had seen some ethereal and majestic carvings at the Quebec Winter Carnival, which had even been dubbed the ""Ice and Snow Carving Olympics."" The teams taking part were from North America, Europe and Asia. There were no carvers from Africa. While still a student in Canada, I worked for a travel agency, which gave me a trip back to the Carnival as a parting gift when I left for Kenya., So when I read the article about our mountains' disappearing snow, I thought, ""Now is the time to do something, Michael. You need to show the effects of climate change in East Africa."", I decided that Africa should be represented at Carnival. I would form an ice and snow-carving team. I had never done any carving before, but I could always learn., Team Kenya made a snow carving called ""Samson in the Temple"" at the 2006 Olympic Ice Arts Festival in Bardonecchia, Italy. Michael Kaloki hide caption, So I set out to find some teammates., I spoke to my buddy, television producer Robert Bresson, about my idea. He agreed to ask around. ""Everyone I have spoken to thinks you are crazy, Michael,"" was his report. But we didn't give up., Robert took me to the Nairobi National Museum. At that time, there were some sculptors who worked on the museum grounds. I introduced myself to the first one I saw and asked, ""Would you want to form an ice-carving team?"", ""Ice?"" he said., ""Yes, ice,"" I said., ""Sure, why not? By the way, my name is Peter Walala."", I now had one team member. The teams I'd seen in Quebec had three or four members. So I needed to find at least one more., I approached the ""Miss Tourism Kenya"" pageant holders and told them about my plans. I felt having a title holder on the team would make it more visible. Winnie Omwakwe, who was ""Miss Earth Kenya,"" was glad to join in. Now we had three team members and one with carving skills. However, Peter had never worked with ice before, only wood and stone., First, we needed to gel as a team. After all, we were total strangers. So we met for a couple of teas and coffees and decided that we were all OK to work with each other., But we needed somewhere to practice. As we deemed it impossible to get to the top of Mount Kiliminjaro or Mount Kenya, we decided to try to find a big hotel freezer. I requested to meet with a director of one of the country's premier hotel chains, and he agreed. I told him about our plan to take part in one of the world's top ice and snow-carving events. He looked shocked at first, but seemed to warm up to the idea., About a week later, he asked to see me. ""A chef at one of our hotels is really thrilled about the plan you have and he would be glad to help you,"" he said. The chef gave us a cold room that fit about six people and left us to it., For weeks, we spent most of our days at one of the city's top hotels. We froze water in the hotel's big urns and Peter would try to figure out the best way to carve it. Then he would teach us what to do. Winnie felt that sitting in 39 degrees was a bit cold and she also had a lot of pageant obligations to attend to. So most of the time it was just me and Peter carving away., Even after we were accepted into the Carnival, there were more hurdles, such as getting flights and visas. Visas turned out to be no problem. We sent in our applications and were approved. It seemed the Canadians were giving us a chance to prove ourselves to the world!, Kenyan ice-carving team of Michael Kaloki (left) and Peter Walala, seen here working the ice in Toronto, represented Africa at Quebec's 2003 Winter Carnival and spread their message about climate change. Ron Bull/Toronto Star via Getty Images hide caption, Kenyan ice-carving team of Michael Kaloki (left) and Peter Walala, seen here working the ice in Toronto, represented Africa at Quebec's 2003 Winter Carnival and spread their message about climate change., Getting flights was harder. Peter was a member of a local arts trust, and they offered him a ticket under one of their grants. He left for Canada, while Winnie and I tried to figure out what to do. I had done some freelance video work for a local production company and they owed me a bit of money. It wasn't enough, but I would try to figure out where to get more. While waiting to pick up my check, the company's owner, Moses Nderitu, happened to see me., ""Michael, you had told me about wanting to start an ice-carving team. Whatever happened to that idea?"" he asked. I told him I had formed the team and we'd been accepted into the Quebec Winter Carnival, but I did not have enough money for a flight. ""Let me take care of the rest of the money for a ticket,"" he said., I could not believe it! Here was someone who believed in me! My parents and many of my friends had thought what I was trying to do was absurd. Moses arranged for me to get my ticket, and we decided that Winnie would see what she could do to get to Canada. Sadly, she never made it to the event., Arriving in Quebec was like arriving for the premier of a Hollywood movie starring Peter and me. The Canadian press had heard about us and had decided that our story was something their audience would be interested in., When I got to our working area of the Carnival, Peter had already started on the snow sculpture we'd decided on: a mother rhino shielding her baby. Before his arrival, Peter had never touched snow. We had practiced at the hotel using ice, now here we were facing a large mound of snow. We had a few days to work on it. We did the best we could, learning by watching other snow sculptors use their carving tools, many of which we'd never seen., In the meantime, during our press interviews, we talked about the impact climate change was having on Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya. On the last day of carving, we finally saw that we had done, well, an amazing job. To our delight, we were informed that the Kenyan government was sending a team from the embassy in Ottawa to attend the final day of the event. We felt like VIPs!, On the final day, it was announced that we had won a prize. ""The Volunteers Award"" went to Team Kenya! As we walked across the snow field to receive it, members from the Kenyan embassy shouted in jubilation. I looked across at Peter and saw that tears were freely flowing down his face.

Then Fiona came.,Adrian Florido,"Brothers Ian, Jahxiel and Isaac Rodríguez run the bases at the damaged baseball park in their neighborhood, Lajas Arriba, in Lajas, Puerto Rico. Erika P. Rodríguez for NPR hide caption, Brothers Ian, Jahxiel and Isaac Rodríguez run the bases at the damaged baseball park in their neighborhood, Lajas Arriba, in Lajas, Puerto Rico., LAJAS, Puerto Rico — It had been almost exactly five years since Hurricane Maria tore across Puerto Rico, destroying the baseball diamond a short walk from Carlos Rodríguez Malavé's house. But by this summer, the ballpark's restoration was finally complete., The infield dirt was freshly graded, a sturdy chain link fence lined the outfield, and a new metal roof over the bleachers replaced the one Maria had blown away., Rodríguez was giddy about it. He'd been itching for years to form a free children's league so his three young sons could learn baseball on the same diamond he'd learned on as a boy. But the park's broken lighting system — battered by Maria's 150-mph winds in 2017 — had made evening practices impossible. Now with repairs finished, he could finally do it., Officials in Rodríguez's small rural town, Lajas, asked him to be the first to turn on the newly restored lights. So on an evening in mid-August, he opened up the metal box tucked away behind the third base foul line and flipped the switches inside, bathing the ball field in golden light., Carlos Rodríguez Malavé with his sons Jahxiel, Ian and Isaac. Before Hurricane Fiona damaged their neighborhood ballpark in September, Rodríguez had formed a league for children. He was one of the coaches. Erika P. Rodríguez for NPR hide caption, ""It was the most elegant thing you've ever seen,"" Rodríguez recalled. Neighbors whose homes face the park came out to cheer. ""We had been waiting five years for that. Ever since Maria."", Within days, he and the town's recreation director partnered up to form the league and started coaching 40 children on the field three evenings a week. They ordered uniforms and were planning an inauguration ceremony., But within a month, they had to shut it all down., On Sept. 18, Hurricane Fiona – Puerto Rico's first hurricane since Maria — made landfall on the island's southwestern coast, just a few miles from the ballfield. Sometime overnight, the storm's 100-mile-per-hour wind gusts knocked over one of the newly repaired light posts. It crashed down over a fence, mangling the lighting system's wiring and knocking it out of service again. The diamond flooded too., Rodríguez realized what had happened the next morning, when he went on a walk through the neighborhood after the worst of the storm had passed., ""I saw that fallen light post, and my heart fell to the ground,"" he said on a recent evening, standing near home plate with his sons Jahxiel, 9, Ian, 7, and Isaac, 6. ""So much work had gone into the field. It was finally in good shape. And we only got to use it for a month. Who knows how long we'll have to wait again?"", Hurricane Fiona flooded homes, washed away roads, and tore off roofs in communities across the island. But in some places – like in Rodríguez's neighborhood — heartbreak over the destruction was deepened by the fact that what Fiona destroyed had only recently been rebuilt from the damage Maria had inflicted, and often at great effort., The ballfield's floodlights — damaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017 — had been repaired, allowing neighborhood children to practice baseball and softball after dark. Hurricane Fiona toppled one of the lightposts, knocking the system out of service again. Erika P.

Rodríguez for NPR hide caption, Contractors for the island's electric utility company worked to restore power in Lajas last month., In the mountain town of Utuado, the raging waters of the Caonillas River swept away a temporary bridge that FEMA had put up to replace one that collapsed during Maria. In the coastal town of Loíza, a fishermen's cooperative had finally gotten long-delayed federal reconstruction funding to repair the building its members use to process and sell their daily catch. Workers had just started removing damaged roof panels when Fiona arrived. The building flooded through the open ceiling., Fiona was far less destructive than Maria was, but Puerto Rico officials estimate the Category 1 hurricane caused $5 billion in damage to public infrastructure. Officials have not said how much of that was infrastructure that Maria had also damaged and that — like the Lajas baseball diamond — had already been repaired or was in the process., After Hurricane Maria destroyed it in 2017, the ballpark's broken lighting system had been a main impediment to forming a baseball and softball Little League in the neighborhood. The darkness had made evening practice impossible. Erika P. Rodríguez for NPR hide caption, But in Lajas, the town's mayor and its residents have been left to figure out how they'll fix their baseball diamond yet again., ""It's like we've gone back five years in time,"" the mayor, Jayson Martínez, said. ""You can't detain Mother Nature, but seeing our park damaged again so soon after we finished it, that hurt. And the recuperation is going to be the same experience as before. Slow."", The recent repairs were funded from the billions that Congress approved for post-Maria reconstruction almost five years ago — money only now starting to trickle into communities. FEMA is also freeing up money to fix damage caused by Fiona. But Martínez fears accessing this money, too, will take years., ""We'll have to wait and see what process FEMA rolls out,"" he said., Willie Rivera's home faces the Lajas Arriba ballpark. He said that before Hurricane Fiona damaged the park again, its recent repairs and the nighttime lighting had brought out more children, infusing the neighborhood with a youthful energy that had been absent for years. Erika P. Rodríguez for NPR hide caption, The ballpark's repairs had been relatively simple, and along with fixes to an adjacent basketball court, had cost less than $100,000. But Lajas is one of Puerto Rico's poorest municipalities, and it hadn't had the money. It took town officials years to get it by working through the bureaucratic morass that has slowed the disbursement of post-Maria reconstruction funds all across the U.S. territory., Which is why to Martínez, finishing the project, as small as it may have been, had felt like a triumph – a reason for his town of 23,000 people to celebrate after years of lurching from one crisis to another., Maria had wrecked many homes in Lajas and left parts of the town without power for close to a year. Then in early 2020, destructive earthquakes centered just off its coast damaged more homes. Families all across the town, fearful their houses would collapse next, spent months sleeping in their driveways or in the street while they awaited engineering inspections. Then came the pandemic., After all that, the restored baseball park had served as a symbol this summer that despite every setback, Lajas could, and would, continue to take steps toward normalcy., ""It's always important to try to move forward,"" the mayor said., Willie Rivera, a retiree who lives alone in a house facing the ballfield, said that for the four weeks before Fiona that the new floodlights had illuminated the ballpark, evenings in the Lajas Arriba neighborhood had filled with a youthful energy he hadn't felt there in years., ""Oh, yes,"" Rivera said. ""The kids came out and used it. It was very nice."", Sitting on his porch plucking out traditional Puerto Rican melodies on his 10-stringed cuatro, he noticed that older neighbors also started venturing out after dark to walk laps on a small track next to the baseball diamond. He'd almost done so himself., Home plate at the Lajas Arriba neighborhood baseball park. Erika P. Rodríguez for NPR hide caption, Normangeline Vázquez, the town's recreation director and volunteer softball coach, said the still unrepaired damage to ballfields, basketball courts, athletic tracks and playgrounds across the island is one of many overlooked tragedies still plaguing Puerto Rico five years after Maria. Fiona has made it worse., ""Our children have been through so much,"" she said. ""And these parks are where they get to play, where our communities go to relieve the stress from everything we've gone through."", Normangeline Vázquez, the recreation director for the town of Lajas, had started coaching softball and baseball on the newly restored field. Recreational facilities are crucial community resources, she said, but across Puerto Rico many have yet to be repaired five years after Hurricane Maria. Erika P. Rodríguez for NPR hide caption, But in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, recreational facilities fall down the list of priorities. After Fiona, Vázquez and every other municipal employee in Lajas set aside their normal duties to become an emergency responder – zipping around in golf carts to deliver food, water, ice and medicine to residents who went weeks without power. They checked on aging neighbors, patched up roofs and set up generators., Meanwhile, the baseball diamond that the town's maintenance workers had so meticulously been caring for before the storm, started to become unkempt, and then overgrown. Town officials closed it to residents, out of fear the floodlights that remained standing might topple next, and because the exposed wiring from the one that did collapse could be dangerous once the neighborhood's power was restored., Vázquez said the ball field's lighting system will be repaired again. How long it will take, she said, is hard to predict., ""The mayor and I are going to do everything we can to get it fixed as soon as we can,"" she said. ""Because if you fall three times, you pick yourself up three times."", As Carlos Rodríguez walked around the infield on a recent evening, taking in the damage, his three sons tugged on his shirt., ""Can we go get our gloves?"" Ian, his 7-year-old, whispered., Rodríguez frowned and shook his head no. He was dying to let them, but the ballpark was technically closed. The boys raced each other around the bases instead., ""Our kids enjoy themselves here and they develop their skills,"" he said. ""But if they don't have places to do that, we're making it harder for them to achieve great things in the future. These disasters have been hard for us, but they've also been hard for our children."", Until he can start his league up again, Rodríguez has been driving his sons to play in one in the city of Ponce, 45 minutes away.

For the last couple weeks, we've been following these trends through one route that many people take, from Senegal to Morocco to Spain.Well, now to get a broader view of how Europe is approaching these challenges, NPR's Eleanor Beardsley joins us from Paris. Hey, Eleanor. Hey, Ari. I want to start with a reporting trip you just made to Calais in the north of France, just on the other side of the English Channel from Britain. And it sounds like there are some real parallels between what you saw there and what we saw when we visited the land border between Morocco and Spain. Tell us about it. Yeah. You know, Ari, I heard your reporting, and you spoke in one segment about the migrants being chased out of the hill around Nador door in Morocco, where they wait to try to get into Melilla, which is a Spanish European enclave. You see the same thing in Calais and Dunkirk, where migrants camp and wait for their chance to cross the English Channel to get into the U.K., where they believe their chances of finding a job and getting asylum are better.You know, several years ago, there was a huge camp in the dunes there in Calais. They called it the Jungle. Officials dismantled it, but the problem did not go away. Migrants continue to come, and they're just in more dispersed encampments everywhere. The biggest is now around Dunkirk, not far from a beach where migrants try to cross the English Channel in rickety boats or rafts operated by smugglers.I spoke with 18-year-old Salah, who didn't want to give his last name. He was sitting with two friends who were 16 around a tiny fire amidst puddles and trash trying to keep warm. They were all from Sudan. Here they are.Why did you leave Sudan? Sudan's not a safe country. There is lots of war. So that's why. So you feel better here than in Sudan? Yeah, a hundred percent, I feel better. Ari, he says he's tried to get into the U.K. by hiding in cars and trucks to go through the Channel Tunnel. He's been caught, but he's going to keep trying. You mentioned that big camp called the Jungle that officials dismantled. And you and I both reported from the Jungle in 2015, when the vast majority of the people living there were from the Middle East - Syria and Afghanistan. So who is camping out in Calais these days? Well, I did not meet a single Syrian. There are many Sudanese, Somalians, where there is war and drought, and the Afghans are still there. There seem to be more of them since the Taliban took over. I met an Afghan lawyer who could no longer practice. He said the Taliban told him, none of your laws apply in this country anymore. And are you seeing the same kind of zero-tolerance policy from French officials that we saw from Moroccan officials? Absolutely, Ari. We have reports of the police really harassing the migrants. Nothing seems to have changed. It's like a cat-and-mouse game, as it's been described. Aid workers say what's needed is a European-wide solution to let these migrants legally apply for asylum in Britain without resorting to smugglers. Instead, the French and British just trade blame, and the two countries have a new agreement. It's just a couple weeks old. Britain will pay France 75 million euros a year for France to increase police surveillance on the beaches.But I spoke with Pierre Roques, who's with the humanitarian group L'Auberge des Migrants. He said the extra police will only make life more miserable for the migrants, and it won't stop them from coming. He says French officials should work to make people's lives a little less miserable and dire. People are not going to come in Calais from Afghanistan because we have - you have two more toilets or, like, some more heating system. It doesn't work like this. This is a narrative of fiction from the far right. All right. Let's talk about what all of this means for the far right because we have seen anti-immigrant politicians gain power across Europe, from Italy to Sweden, Poland, Hungary. So how is the continent shifting on this issue? And do they acknowledge that climate change is a factor here? Yeah. Europeans know that climate change, especially in Africa, will push more people to come. But there is a growing weariness of migration from the African continent. You know, the million-plus Syrian migrants from the Middle East who went into Germany in 2015 because of their war, they definitely empowered the far-right party there. You've seen the far-right party gain many more seats in the French parliament this year. And in Italy, which is on the front lines of immigration - it has taken in nearly 90,000 migrants fleeing Africa in boats this year alone - there is a new far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who is cracking down. And she recently refused to let a boat carrying rescued migrants dock. That's NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris. Thanks a lot. Thank you, Ari. ",Climate
https://www.npr.org/2022/11/25/1139231006/the-u-s-military-takes-measures-to-protect-bases-from-flooding,2022-11-25,The U.S. military takes measures to protect bases from flooding,Quil Lawrence,"The United Nations Climate Change conference wrapped up last week in Egypt with dire warnings about warmer temperatures and higher seas. Here in the U.S., one institution taking the threat seriously is the military, for very practical reasons. Bases near the water's edge could soon be under it. NPR's Quil Lawrence sent this report from Hampton Roads, Va. This fall on the Virginia coast, there was a king tide, one of the highest tides of the year. Outside an apartment building in Norfolk, members of a group called Wetlands Watch were handing out pamphlets. Why are you putting those on the car?MARY- I'm putting them on the car to tell people about the flooding that's going to happen. Mary-Carson Stiff and her daughter stuck pamphlets on the windshields of parked cars. OK. Virginia (ph), can you help me? Can you hand me one? OK, hand me this one. Oh, thank you very much. The locals know this lot will most likely flood. It's maybe more recent arrivals who park here. See all the license plates that are out of state. There's an easy fix. People can move to the lot on the other side of the building, which is a foot or two higher. Stiff says she does the same thing at her house when there's a storm surge. So during flood events, our driveway is angled up. You pull your car up next to your house. And the street is wet. And you can't get out. But at least your home is dry, and your cars aren't ruined. So that's adaptation here in the wet part of Norfolk, Va. Also out here with the pamphlets is Skip Stiles, director of Wetlands Watch. This section of the road just floods all the time. He formerly spent decades working these issues in Washington. Now he gets visitors from Washington tours of all the streets in Norfolk that will turn into lakes during high tide. There's one just across the parking lot. Building codes have been playing catch up with the rising flood levels. Stiles points to some of the houses built up on cinder blocks, 3 feet or 6 feet or 11 feet off the ground, depending on the estimate of storm surge the year they were built. So these houses were safe when they were elevated in 2003. And then those houses over there that are maybe 9 feet up were safe when they were elevated in 2011. And these houses that are way up in the air were the most recent ones to be elevated. That's 11 foot. These are safe now in 2022. It's an odd sight, uneven rows of houses that look like a game of Tetris. And it's the same thing on many of the half-dozen military bases around Norfolk. Colonel Lisa Mabbutt drove me around Langley Air Force Base on the other side of the river. So we've just passed a new hospital facility here. And so new construction, we're required to put that new construction on essentially a platform at the 11-foot level. In her 22 years with the Air Force, Mabbutt has seen climate change and sea level rise become accepted facts in the military despite shifting political tides. On Langley Air Force Base, it happened with a hurricane in 2006. Hurricane Isabel caused a 7- to 8-foot flood surge on the base. Operations - normal operations on the base were down for about a week. The airfield was shut down for about four days. The great thing about Isabel is that it gave us a lot of lessons learned. Like the community outside the gates, Langley has made some adaptations - steel flood gates around some building doorways and small sea walls, putting the electricity grid above the flood level. They've also done some things the community can't. At 1 of 6 pump stations on the base, a hatch opens over a 30-foot deep, 162,000-gallon tank. Tunnels big enough to drive a car in connect it to drains near the airfield. Pump stations like this to gather the water and give it a holding area while the ambient water level goes down and then get it off the base as fast as we can. Those actually - had we had those in place for Isabel, we would have been able to get the mission back online quicker, and we definitely would have been able to mitigate some of the financial damage. With all four pumps, it can clear 7 million gallons an hour. They give me a little demonstration pumping out the past week's rainwater. Mabbutt's message is this - sea levels are rising faster than ever, but that still gives the military decades to adapt. And it is adapting. This base is here to stay, as it has been here for a long time, particularly and perhaps because we have spent so much time trying to live with the water and find ways to absorb the unique environment that we're in. Norfolk and the Norfolk areas have been at the forefront of climate resilience efforts for the Department of Defense for a long time. John Conger is a former senior Pentagon official. He mentions the sea wall that's nearly complete around Norfolk Naval Shipyard. It's an achievement, he says, but it will have taken 10 years from being proposed to its completion in 2023. That kind of lead time is necessary. And so the projects that are developed are going to have to be able to persevere across administrations and across Congresses and have broad support. Conger worries that the projects the military needs 10 years from now are not already in the pipeline. There's a huge backlog of base maintenance, he says. And the DOD still hasn't completed resilience plans for many installations, which is just the first step on that decade-long journey. Some of the main roads connecting the base to town flooded during the king tide. Skip Stiles with Wetlands Watch in Norfolk says, with the military's backlog of climate resilience projects, the surrounding communities could be left behind. After I fix my base, then I'll take care of you, because it all comes out of MilCon - out of the military construction appropriations. So all of this civilian stuff is in the same pot of money as all the on-base defense stuff. So if you think the uniformed services are going to give up their nickels and dimes so you can raise a road outside the wire - right? - I don't think that's going to happen. And these bases are not islands. Many troops live off base in the community, as does a huge workforce of civilians that support the bases. How far out of the gate does the military have to pay for raising the road? Military and civilian officials say they haven't worked that out yet, but they both know the water is coming.

Now it's becoming a model for other military bases on combating climate effects. Jay Price of member station WUNC reports from South Carolina's LowcountryJAY PRICE Scientists think a permanent solution to the rising water here isn't possible, so the question is how to keep enough of the iconic training base for new recruits above water, at least for a few more decades. Tracey Spencer, the base environmental director, stands atop one of the causeways on Parris Island that support major roads. This road is about 10 feet above sea level. She points across a saltwater pond to another road named Malecon Drive. And Malecon is not. But whenever that road is repaved, we'll probably do the art of the small. The art of the small - that's a phrase they use here a lot. In this case, it means wait till the road needs repaving, and then spend a little more to raise it higher, rather than spend millions now to lift the road while the pavement is still good. One projection says low areas here could flood more than 300 times a year by 2050. Base officials don't think the water will rise that quickly, but Spencer says that they're still taking some steps. Whether the model shows that it's a six-inch difference or a 16-foot difference, it doesn't matter. If we raise the road two feet, it's still a benefit to us. If we plant native plants, it's still a benefit to us. The art of the small is expected to play a key role in new climate resilience plans the Navy will finish next month for Parris Island and Naval Station San Diego. Meredith Berger is an assistant secretary of the Navy. She says these plans will help the Navy figure out how to craft similar ones for more than 90 other installations. So one Marine Corps base, one Navy base, but places where we have the opportunity to learn. The art of the small isn't new. For years, the Navy has done things like build piers higher when it's time to replace them. But Berger said Parris Island has helped institutionalize the approach. Finding every opportunity to make a little change that has a big impact - that is an ethos. That is an approach that everyone is taking because we need to be thinking about this at every turn. At Parris Island, the Navy has already taken steps like rebuilding key parts of shooting ranges higher and farther from the shore. It's also added solar panels and giant Tesla batteries to make the power grid more storm resistant. And it's planting new oyster beds to protect the shoreline. But still... They will have to abandon that base and those activities at some point in the future. That's certain. Rob Young heads the program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University. Less certain, he says, is the timeline, which depends partly on whether humans begin to slow the effects of climate change. But the fact that, eventually, Parris Island will have to close doesn't mean that has to happen any time soon. I think there are places in this country that we will spend money on even for short-term solutions. He cites Tidewater, Va., where he grew up. It's home to a host of crucial military installations, and flooding is already a big problem there. Young says he'd never say it's pointless to spend money at places like Parris Island to slow the impacts. As long as DOD and base command is really taking seriously this idea that they're not going to be there 50 years from now. So unless something like catastrophic hurricane damage changes the equation, the art of the small, along with some larger measures, could make sense - for at least a while longer.For NPR News, I'm Jay Price at Parris Island, S.C.

Deadly floods killed some 1,700 people and affected more than 30 million. Climate change helped drive that devastation. Well, now, in a historic first, a fund will help compensate countries for that sort of damage. Negotiators at the U.N. climate conference agreed in the final hours that the world's richest countries, which are most responsible for global warming, will pay into a pot of money to help poorer countries deal with climate disasters. Pakistan led the bloc of developing countries known as the G-77 at those negotiations. And Pakistan's foreign minister, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, joins us now. Welcome. Thank you for having me. How big a victory is this agreement for you? I think that this is a big victory, not for any one individual or one country, but this is a big victory for all of those who've suffered from the devastation of climate change. And it's something that has been a long-standing demand to allow countries who suffer exorbitantly as a result from climate change, but didn't necessarily contribute as much to the position we find ourselves in, for them to have an opportunity. There's still a lot to be decided. Tell us what the most immediate questions are and what the timeline is to answer them. The questions are - who's going to contribute to the fund, how are we going to come up with the international financial mechanisms and who are we going - are we going to get it to those who need it the most? Our time frame is the next COP hosted in the United Arab Emirates. And I think that that's sort of a good target for everyone to achieve. In the past, countries have failed to keep similar promises. Are you worried that they won't follow through this time? So as the chair of G-77 plus China, obviously many, many countries are worried about our inability in the past to live up to some of our commitments. And I think that is why it was so important to have the language on the fund. And I think it does. It goes a long way to show that people are committed to this. But ultimately, it's not binding, right? There's no consequences if developed countries don't follow through. You're kind of taking it on faith. Well, I think that the sort of the consequences for our planet, as in for all of us, not just for the Global North, but also the Global South, not just for the developed world, but also for the developing world. And being in the position of chair of G-77 plus China, it was all the more important for us, having gone through this tragedy, that this had to get done. You've referred to G-77 plus China, which is the group of developing nations. China is currently the world's largest emitter, although the U.N. still considers it a developing country, and China has opposed paying into the fund. Do you think they should contribute? We've got a commitment to established a fund and financial arrangements to address loss and damage and a timeline attached to that for us to work out the details. I look forward to working with all our partners within G-77 and the UAE, which will be hosting the next COP and to ensure... And you're not going to express an opinion of whether or not China should pay into this? Well, no, it's not about - no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's not about not - about who should or who should not pay into it. We all have to do our part to combat climate change. As far as China is concerned, I recently came back from there, and they're leading the way as far as reforestation, green energy, etc. But we all have to work together to collectively survive and combat these challenges without necessarily, you know, sort of finger-wagging with one side or the other, that, you know, you're doing too much, you're not doing enough. Let's imagine that this does get fully funded. There is still, inevitably, going to be more need than there will be money. So who do you think should get first priority? How should decisions be made about where the money is spent? Oh, that's a very - I think that's a very interesting question. I think that there'll be a difficult - everybody faces their own challenge. I don't think there's going to be a fund big enough that will cover every country. It's not sort of a future problem is now because it's not only Pakistan that has been damaged just this year. In fact, Pakistan was first damaged by historic heat waves, forest fires and a massive drought and then followed by this flooding that you see. So a fund available can, you know, contribute in the way it will. But if I had the space to be able to go to the World Bank, to the IMF, to maybe a climate bank, to other institutions where I would take my own loans at reasonable rates given the fact that I'm dealing with sort of a climate catastrophe that would allow me access to the finances I need to get my own people back on their own feet and be able to counter the various challenges that we face. Despite the fact that this loss and damage fund was established, negotiators at the meeting still could not agree to phase out fossil fuels. And so - big picture - isn't the world still on an unsustainable track? So the picture that the climate scientists are painting are extremely devastating. And for us, that picture became reality for us. This is something that has an urgency for now. I wish that there was a technical option where we could all agree that we're going to turn off our fossil fuel addiction tomorrow. That's not possible. I think it's better that we achieved a practical consensus about something that we can do and can achieve, rather than agreeing to something that we would be unable to achieve as of now. Pakistan's foreign minister, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, thank you for joining us. Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. ",Middle East

Why don't most forecasts mention it?,Rebecca Hersher,"Some mountain trails in the city of Phoenix are open before sunrise and after sunset to encourage hikers to avoid the heat of the midday. A large body of scientific research shows that climate change is making heat waves more severe. Communicating about that climate connection while a heat wave is still underway can affect peoples' attitudes about climate change more broadly. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, At global climate talks that just wrapped up, one of the few areas of agreement was about the worldwide toll of climate-driven weather disasters., Leaders from Pakistan and Kenya, Senegal and the Bahamas connected the dots between a hotter Earth and devastating floods, storms, heat waves and droughts. And in a speech at the conference, President Joe Biden said more severe hurricanes and wildfires are wreaking havoc in the United States., That connection between extreme weather and climate change has never been clearer, thanks to an area of science known as extreme-event attribution. It allows scientists to describe exactly how much worse a specific flood, heat wave, hurricane or drought is because of human-caused global warming., But that science is largely missing from public weather forecasts that millions of people in the U.S. rely on. As severe weather gets more common, scientists and forecasters are contending with a sneakily difficult question: How do we work together to explain the role of climate change?, Years of research have shown how climate change intensifies rain storms, heat waves and hurricanes., But when a disaster is unfolding, the official weather forecasts from the federal government don't include information about how climate change is making the disaster more severe or more likely, even when the connection is well-established by previous studies. The forecasts that most people get on their phones or through television broadcasts are based on official government information., If they did include climate context, weather forecasts for hurricanes might mention how sea level rise or warmer ocean temperatures could make the storm more severe than storms in the past., Similarly, official updates on drought conditions might mention how global warming contributes to longer, more severe droughts. Or heat wave warnings from the National Weather Service could include information about the strong, well-established connection between a hotter Earth and dangerously hot days., Instead, information about that connection comes from researchers, often weeks or months after the disaster happens., , But scientists may not always be the best messengers. Research has found that television meteorologists can be some of the most authoritative voices for lots of people on the connection between climate change and weather., And federal forecasters, such as those at the National Hurricane Center, could also be effective messengers for climate information, says Michael Wehner, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who studies extreme weather. ""Confidence in these statements would be considerably higher,"" he argues, if they were coming as part of forecasts and warnings that people already trust and turn to when a storm is bearing down., But including climate context in real-time weather warnings is easier said than done, says Sarah Kapnick, the chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Kapnick has a background as a research scientist, and has worked on extreme-event attribution studies., ""When an extreme event is happening, NOAA's National Weather Service has a singular focus on protecting lives and property,"" she explains. Forecasters do their best to answer questions about the role of climate change in whatever disaster is unfolding, she says. But ""they don't necessarily know all the science about climate change, and they're not active in doing that type of analysis,"" explains Kapnick., Instead, NOAA scientists separately put out information about how climate change affects hurricanes, floods, heat waves and other severe weather. ""One of the difficulties, when an event is happening, is trying to combine those two into one,"" Kapnick says., NOAA is currently reviewing how it communicates with the public about climate change, she says, in part because of a flood of interest from the public and from local officials who are grappling with more severe weather., Hurricane Ian cause wide spread flooding when it dumped rain across Florida in September. A preliminary analysis found that Ian dumped at least 10% more rain because of climate change. Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinal/Tribune News Service via Getty hide caption, The gap between scientists and forecasters was on full display when Hurricane Ian hit Florida in September. The storm gathered strength over abnormally hot water in the Gulf of Mexico – water made hotter by human-caused global warming., A large body of research shows that warmer oceans can make hurricanes worse by causing storms to dump more rain. Sea level rise in Florida makes storm surge more destructive. And research also suggests that climate change may make it more likely for storms to rapidly intensify, which also happened to Ian. Such storms are dangerous because they get extremely destructive right before hitting land, giving people little time to evacuate., But forecasts and statements from the National Hurricane Center didn't mention how climate change was likely to make Hurricane Ian more severe., The day before the storm made landfall in Florida, the acting director of the hurricane center, Jamie Rhome, appeared on CNN and was asked how climate change might be affecting the storm's intensification. He responded, ""We can come back and talk about climate change at a later time. I want to focus on the here and now."", Pressed by CNN's Don Lemon, Rhome responded, ""I don't think you can link climate change to any one event. On the whole, on the cumulative, climate change may be making storms worse. But to link it to any one event, I would caution against that."", ""That statement was wrong,"" says Wehner. ""It is entirely appropriate for me to say climate change made this event more intense."", Indeed, a preliminary analysis by Wehner and other climate scientists in the days after Ian made landfall estimated that climate change caused the storm to drop at least 10% more rain than it would have without global warming., Asked about Rhome's comments, Rick Spinrad, administrator of NOAA , which oversees the National Hurricane Center, said it is clear that climate change is affecting hurricanes and tropical storms., ""You look at what happened with Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Ian,"" he said in a recent interview with NPR, about two months after Hurricane Ian. ""These storms are dumping feet of rain. We've not tended to see that before. So when you talk about attribution, I think it's unequivocal that we can attribute to climate change the changes in the dynamics of these storms."", But, Spinrad says, the research ""isn't robust enough yet"" for weather forecasters to say exactly how much worse a given weather disaster will be, in real-time. Nor should that necessarily be the primary goal. Instead, he says his agency is focused on giving people information about what to expect in the future. For example, as heat waves get more intense, NOAA hopes to use extreme-event attribution science to beef up its ability to warn people., Humans are habitually focused on the present. Your leaky roof demands more attention than the threat of a future climate-driven flood., That's why the time during and immediately after a weather disaster is so important. People who experience a severe heat wave or hurricane, and who understand that it is connected to climate change, are more likely to take action to protect themselves from future disasters, and to support climate policies, according to research by Gabrielle Wong-Parodi of Stanford University., That includes more support for electric vehicles and policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as well as an interest in doing things like flood-proofing your home., It's unclear how long those attitudes last after a climate-driven disaster. Figuring that out is an active area of research. ""There appears to be this window of time within which you might want to help people better understand what those risks are, and make links to climate change,"" Wong-Parodi explains., ""I think that's really important as we move forward, because it has implications for how we may want to communicate to the public about these types of events,"" says Wong-Parodi.",Climate

No more gas stoves or boilers. But making good on that commitment is proving complicated. Here's NPR's Katia Riddle. Climate activism came easily to Adah Crandall. She was in seventh grade when she organized her first protest. People ask, like, what are your extracurriculars? And I'm like, oh, climate organizing. Recently, Crandall was outside Portland's Grant High School in the pouring rain. She's a sophomore here. She says once she understood the magnitude of the climate crisis, she couldn't ignore it. I do feel like I sort of exist in two separate worlds at this point. Like, there's, like, my student world where I'm like at school, like, being a teenager to the best of my ability and then like, go home and, like, feel like I kind of have to be an adult in a way. She was part of a large coalition of people who worked to establish the new school policy at Portland Public Schools. It took three years. Goals include electric school buses, curriculum for students on climate justice and net zero emissions by 2040. Liam Castles is a fellow organizer. That policy, you know, on paper is really, really good, right? Like, there's a reason it was celebrated as one of the best policies in the nation. Cassells graduated high school last year. He's taking a year off to do climate activism before college. Castles says even when the policy passed, he worried the district wouldn't follow through. But there's exactly one thing it was missing, and that was that accountability piece. Now he and fellow activists are taking issue with another high school that's under renovation. Benson Polytechnic is a few miles away. When it's finished, the building will not look like the energy-efficient buildings the policy describes. It will burn fossil fuels. Mike Rosen is a retired environmental engineer and volunteer who worked on the policy. He says he feels betrayed by the school district. And then they do this 180-degree about-face on their own policy that they just passed. Rosen is standing outside Benson High. Behind him, workers stand on scaffolding amidst cranes and other equipment. He says it's important for the schools to set a good example for kids. It's time for grown-ups to walk their talk. Dan Jung is the chief operating officer at Portland Public Schools. The Benson project does not stop the district from reaching the climate policy goals. When the policy passed, plans for the building had been in place for years. Construction had started months previous. Jung says changing course now would cost between 6 and $8 million. Eventually, he says, the district will retrofit this high school with cleaner, all-electric power. It's unclear when that will be, but right now, he says it's too expensive. It's the cost of stopping a very large capital construction project. Activist Adah Crandall says $8 million may sound like a lot, but the total cost of this project was close to 300 million. With the impacts of climate change already being felt around the world, she says this generation has more to lose than their elders. I used to, like, do theater and play sports and, like, really loved those things. And I try to make time for them still, but it's like this is my priority. That's why Crandall says she's doubling down on holding people in power accountable for their impact on the climate. In this case, it's the administrators at her school district. Next time, it may be someone higher up. Crandall is graduating early. She's thinking seriously about running for office. Katia Riddle, NPR News, Portland.(' """") ",National

This man survived,"Ari Shapiro, Ayen Bior, Miguel Macias, Matt Ozug, Sarah Handel, RICCI SHRYOCK","To see the southernmost land border of Europe, you have to visit Africa. There, you'll find two cities perched on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea - Melilla and Ceuta. They're politically part of Spain, geographically surrounded by Morocco. Melilla tells a story about itself. You can find it on a stone tile in the narrow, winding streets of the old city. The tile has the letter M in four alphabets - Arabic, Latin, Hebrew and Hindi. It represents four groups of people who've lived in this city together for centuries. But like every story of a place, the one Melilla tells is part reality, part mythology. Muslims living here weren't granted citizenship until the 1980s. Before that, they were stateless. And today, the city's history as a cultural mixing bowl is at odds with its place on the front lines of a global upheaval. (Through interpreter) Melilla today is like a bunker. It's like living in an island. Irene Flores has worked as a journalist in Melilla for more than 35 years. She was born and raised in this enclave city of Spain. (Through interpreter) Melilla has grown always looking to Morocco. All the development in the city has to do with Morocco. We met at a cerveceria, a sidewalk cafe where tapas come free with a beer. Snippets of Spanish and Arabic drift over from the surrounding tables. Growing up in Melilla, Irene Flores says, there was virtually no border at all. (Through interpreter) There was no fence. There was no border. It was, like, a free crossing through a checkpoint. No passport required. She could go for a swim on a Moroccan beach in the middle of the day and be back at work reporting from Spain in half an hour. But for journalists these days... (Through interpreter) The issues with the fence could be, like, 85% of the time. The fence is actually multiple fences, four layers deep, more than 20 feet tall, fortified with armed guards patrolling the perimeter. All of that armor is paid for by the European Union to keep out people who've traveled thousands of miles to enter this fortified city. (Through interpreter) Melilla is somehow a gate into Europe. For the past week, we've been reporting on the connection between climate change, global migration and the rise of far right politics. And yesterday, we looked at migration from the Moroccan side of these fences. Today, the view from inside the enclave, beginning with the migrant center where people who successfully crossed the fence await the next step.It's not meant to be a prison, but the outside sure looks like it, with cameras and a guard at the door. As journalists, we're not allowed inside, but we can talk to people who are allowed to come out. (Through interpreter) Well, I made it to Europe. That's all I wanted. Abdo Mohemad Ahmad left his home in Sudan when he was 19 years old. Now he's 23, in a holding pattern at this migrant center, waiting for permission to go to the Spanish mainland. He lists the countries that he's been through on this long, strenuous journey - Sudan, Egypt, Libya... Niger, Algeria... ...Niger, Algeria, Morocco. He didn't call his family for a year. (Through interpreter) I didn't want to give them false hope. So when I entered Morocco a year ago, I finally contacted them. Oh, and what did they say then, hearing from you for the first time in so long? (Through interpreter) Well, they were really happy for me, but at the same time, they yelled at me. Because even if you're in bad shape, they said, we should have known you're alive. In each country he passed through over the last four years, he experienced challenges that he cannot begin to describe. But he can tell us about June 24 of this year. #1: (Yelling, inaudible). (Yelling, inaudible). That date has become a rallying cry. And it continues to make headlines in Spain as the government has come under pressure for withholding information. We'll warn you that in the next minute or so, there will be some graphic descriptions of videos taken that day. #2: (Non-English language spoken). On June 24, Abdo joined a huge crowd of people in Morocco to charge the border fence. Most of them were from Sudan like him. Moroccan police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at the group. According to Morocco and Spain, 23 people died. But the number could be much higher. Human rights groups say more than 70 others who ran at the fence that day are still unaccounted for. Morocco has refused to allow an independent investigation. NPR reached out to the Spanish Interior Ministry about the events of June 24, and they declined to comment. #3: (Non-English language spoken). #4: (Non-English language spoken). The video from that day shows piles of bodies and police dragging people who are injured or dead. One of those killed was Abdo's good friend. (Through interpreter) I was with him three hours before. I started hearing he died. He didn't make it. That was very difficult. Abdo Mohemad Ahmad was one of the lucky ones who made it here to Spain. So did a young man from South Sudan named Steven Khon Khon.When did you leave South Sudan? 2016, yeah. So you've been traveling for six years.He says he'll never forget his friends who died on June 24. Because I'll never forget our brothers, rest in peace. Steven's story is similar to migrants all over the world - spending years crossing borders, being detained, trying again, working in a foreign country to raise enough money to continue the journey. He left home with his younger brother when violence broke out in South Sudan. In Libya, they tried crossing to Europe by boat. I try many time to cross the sea. The police catch me, you know, 15 time. Sometime, when you caught, you put in prison six month, three month. After spending several long stretches in Libyan prisons, Steven and his brother decided to try this land crossing in Morocco instead. But he says Moroccan authorities were relentless. They give us 24 hours. They say, when we find you here, we have problem. Be gone in 24 hours or there would be a problem, authorities said. That was June 23. When they charged the border crossing the next day, Steven reached the other side. His younger brother did not. After six years traveling together, they're now on opposite sides of the fence, in two different countries. The man who oversees this migrant center and others is based in Madrid. And while Carlos Montero wouldn't allow us to tour the facility in Melilla, he did agree to talk with us over Zoom. (Through interpreter) Immigration is like water. If you block it in one place, the water is going to flow out somewhere else. That's just the way it is. That may be true, but the European Union has poured billions of dollars into trying to stop the water from flowing. And far-right political parties across Europe have used a different metaphor. #5: (Non-English language spoken). Those politicians compare migrants to poison - something to be cleansed from the continent. #5: (Non-English language spoken). In Spain, the far-right party Vox has compared immigrants to animals. #5: (Non-English language spoken). A different, center-right political party governed Melilla for most of the last 20 years. Miguel Marin is a leader of that party. And so at his office in the center of Melilla, I ask him about the steady militarization of the border. (Non-English language spoken). He blames the leftist national government in Madrid and says, Spain needs immigrants. Our population is aging. But migration has to be controlled, he says, through legal pathways.What you are saying is something that we hear all the time. I'm not against immigration. I'm only against illegal immigration, people often say. And last week we were in Senegal. And we spoke to many people who said, I went to the embassy. I asked for a work visa. And I was told no again, again, again. And so do you think the system needs to change to allow more people to come to the country legally? (Non-English language spoken). Yes, and not only in Spain, he says. The whole world needs a system where countries that need manual labor can regulate migration from anywhere. I ask him about the way journalist Irene Flores described Melilla - the city that is a gateway but also a bunker. And I wanted to know, how do you balance the two? (Non-English language spoken). Miguel Marin bristles, and his blue eyes flare. ""Melilla is not a bunker in any sense,"" he says. ""Look at your country. The U.S. has a bigger, longer fence on its border with Mexico. Is the United States a bunker?"" (Non-English language spoken). Nearly 300 miles northwest of Melilla, we meet a friend of Steven Khon Khon's. He's the man we met at the migrant center earlier. Husein Mohamed sits in the town of Espartinas. He is in mainland Spain with two Sudanese friends. They sip coffee at an outdoor food court packed with locals. This group has been through so much together. They're really more like brothers now.Did you all travel together? Si. Wow.Months before that June incident where so many people died, Husein Mohamed jumped the fence in Melilla. When we tell him that we met his friend Steven, Husein opens his iPad and plays a video for us. #6: (Non-English language spoken). #7: (Non-English language spoken). That's outside of Melilla? I was care - my friend. I was very happy. The video shows Husein and others outside the migrant center welcoming the group that had just crossed the border on June 24, including Steven. They're high fiving each other. Husein is carrying a newcomer on his shoulders. And while Husein's fully dressed, his friend is shirtless, his pants completely ripped from the struggle to cross the fences. Shortly after that video, when Husein finally arrived on the Spanish mainland, he broke down. When I enter here, I was crying. I can think of so many reasons to cry. Which reason were you crying? Six years on the road. Were you crying from happiness or sadness or the people who didn't survive or your pain or all the... All of it - I was happy and very sad. If you could talk to the Husein of six years ago, what would you tell him? Keep going. Keep going. Don't give up. We recorded that conversation with Husein on October 16. Soon after that, Steven was transferred from Melilla to mainland Spain. Now he's in Barcelona, while Husein is still in Espartinas. Without papers, they can't get jobs. But they've applied for asylum and hope to get approved in about a month. So they have to keep going, keep going just a little while longer. ","NA"

A federal judge this week threw out the pandemic border restrictions known as Title 42, and that comes just as migrant apprehensions are already at record levels. I want to bring in two guests now to help us understand what this all means, both at the border and beyond. We've got Angela Kocherga with member station KTEP in El Paso, Texas, and NPR's Joel Rose reporting from Washington. Hey to both of you. Hey, Ailsa. Hi, Ailsa. So, Joel, I want to start with you. Can you just remind us what is Title 42 and how much have immigration authorities relied on it over the course of the pandemic? A lot. I mean, immigration authorities have used these pandemic border restrictions called Title 42 more than 2 million times to quickly expel migrants without giving them a chance to first seek asylum in the U.S. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled this week that Title 42 is unlawful because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should have considered less drastic alternatives to protect the country from COVID-19 and also ignored the possible harms of expelling these migrants to Mexico. But the judge agreed to stay that ruling for five weeks with great reluctance, he wrote in all caps, to give the Biden administration more time to prepare for an orderly transition. OK. Well, Angela, you've been in Juarez this week, just across the border from El Paso. What was the reaction there when they all found out this news? Well, Ailsa, I was at a migrant camp located right on the banks of the Rio Grande. And everyone there was aware that Title 42 is ending soon. The news had traveled very fast, and they were cautiously optimistic and very relieved. Now, the only decision left for most was when to turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents at a mobile processing center just across the river. So it's all been very orderly. And I talked with Juan Sanchez, who had been living at this camp for a month, and he was very ready to leave. My friends are telling me that we can cross. Maybe we have a chance. I hope so. We are professionals. We are working people. So about a thousand people have been camped there for about a month. There are no portable bathrooms. And Mei Castillo, someone else I met there, she's a mother of three, she's been sleeping in a donated tent with her husband and her children. (Speaking Spanish). She says the tents do not provide shelter from the tremendous cold, and the temperatures have been dipping below freezing. So no one wants to be there longer than they have to. Border Patrol is telling people not to cross, that they'll be turned back because Title 42 has not ended yet. But the migrants say so far, they're not seeing people from the camp being sent back. And that camp is emptying out as more and more people cross. I imagine so. Well, meanwhile, Joel, you've been following the reaction in Washington. What are lawmakers saying about this ruling so far? There's concern about even greater numbers of migrants trying to cross the border illegally if and, you know, when Title 42 ends. And we heard that today from senators on both sides of the aisle at a hearing with the secretary of Homeland Security, including Republican James Lankford of Oklahoma and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. A lot of people counting on these numbers coming down, and they're not. They're going up. With the end of Title 42 coming in 35 days, we expect it's going to accelerate even higher. With the sudden announcement that Title 42 will be terminated in December, I'm extremely worried the DHS is not ready and that border communities and migrants will suffer the costs for this lack of preparation. You know, we heard these same concerns back in the spring when the Biden administration was preparing to end Title 42 voluntarily. In fact, Senators Sinema and Lankford introduced a bill back then that would have extended these border restrictions. Their bill didn't get very far, in part because a federal judge in Louisiana blocked the Biden administration from ending Title 42 then. But we could potentially see that bill or something like it resurrected now during the lame-duck session. Well, going back to El Paso, Angela, how ready do you think the city government there and all the organizations out there that help migrants, how ready will they be, you think, for more influx? Yeah. Well, they've been through this before. Over the summer, large groups of Venezuelans were crossing the border and arriving in El Paso. So the city says it can open what they call a welcome center to help the migrants find shelter - temporary shelter, that is - and make travel arrangements. And they're dedicating 60 city workers to help nonprofit organizations because they're struggling to find enough volunteers. All of this is very expensive. So they want the federal government to quickly provide funding, $3 million to start. And the city is owed $7 million for the spike in migration this summer. There are no plans to resume that bussing migrants to New York program, but some nonprofit organizations may help arrange travel by bus or plane to other destination. OK. So calls for more federal funding. Joel, what is the Biden administration saying about those calls and about preparations right now? Well, they say they'll be ready. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas appeared before a Senate committee today and said DHS has a plan that includes surging more resources to the border and also more enforcement under the immigration laws that were in place before Title 42. Enhancing the consequences for unlawful entry, especially with respect to individuals who seek to evade law enforcement, including removal, detention and criminal prosecution when warranted. Again, these are a lot of the same things Mayorkas said back in the spring. Any increase in detention or deportation is not going to sit well with immigrant advocates and many Democrats. It's also possible the Biden administration could still try to appeal the judge's ruling on Title 42, up to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals or beyond just because the White House doesn't have a lot of other great options here. That is NPR's Joel Rose and Angela Kocherga with member station KTEP.

People gathering at the U.N. climate conference in Egypt this week are getting a taste of this new product, which is being touted as a climate-friendly alternative. NPR's Allison Aubrey reports. When it comes to climate change solutions, there's a lot of focus on the food system. That's because about one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions come from food production, many directly from meat. I'm Joshua March, co-founder and CEO here at SCiFi Foods. SCiFi Foods is one of more than 50 startups staking a future in cultivated meat. March is developing an alternative to the traditional burger because, he says, beef has a big environmental footprint. It's responsible for a huge amount of methane emissions, which is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, deforestation of the rainforest. Trees are cut down to create pasture to graze cattle. Land is needed to grow grain to feed the animals. And climate scientists warn that it's nearly impossible to meet climate goals without changing agriculture. March says telling people to eat less meat won't work. Global demand for animal protein is on the rise, and burgers are one of Americans' favorite foods. But he thinks there may be a growing appetite for an alternative. If you go to most people and say, wouldn't it be amazing if we could produce real meat but do it without the need to kill an animal and without the need to cut down the rainforests and all the other stuff that comes with it, most people will say, like, yeah, that would be amazing. And that's what we're doing. That's what they aim to do. Cultivated meat is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but over the last few years, companies have forged ahead. They've raised hundreds of millions of dollars for research and development. One of the first startups in the space, called GOOD Meat, is much further along. Here's GOOD Meat's Andrew Noyes. We're the only company in the world that has regulatory approval to sell anywhere in the world, and that is in Singapore. They made headlines a couple of years ago when they began to sell cultivated chicken in a restaurant in Singapore. And GOOD Meat is serving up its chicken at the climate conference this week in Egypt, making a case that could be good for the environment. One of the first questions people ask before trying it is, exactly how do you grow meat? We took a tour of their production facility near San Francisco. Welcome to GOOD Meat's pilot plant building. We've been finishing up the construction and commissioning. GOOD Meat's Peter Czerpak walks us into a space that looks like a brewery. It's filled with big, shiny, stainless-steel tanks. The one on the right is 3,500 liters. It stretches from floor to ceiling. This is where the process starts. They've extracted a bunch of cells from chickens. Now they need to feed these cells a mix of proteins, fats and carbohydrates - same things the cells would get if they were in an animal's body. You can also add some nutrients as they're slowly growing. Just like all of us, if you need a snack in the middle of the day, sometimes the cells may need a snack as well. The feed is mixed into a liquid and piped into the tanks where the cells will grow, and they're looked after closely. You're watching that they're just the right temperature. They don't have a fever. You're watching that they're the right pH. Then the cells start to proliferate and grow into meat. GOOD Meat scientist Vitor Espirito Santo says what's happening here is akin to making sourdough bread from a starter full of yeast. So when you think about yeast fermentation, you have a cell that essentially proliferates in a cultured media. And that - by dividing, it's producing the product we want. He says the difference here, of course, is the cells are animal cells. The processes are the same. We feed them with nutrients, and they will multiply until we tell them to stop. The meat grows inside the tanks on trays. After it comes out, it's molded into shapes such as nuggets or fillet. After three to four weeks, they're ready for the grill. GOOD Meat's in-house chef Chris Jones prepared a grilled chicken dish in a clay pot with mushrooms. Just doing a really umami-style mushroom glaze and actually just leaving the chicken basically naked. He adds some asparagus, brown rice and quinoa.Well, it definitely looks beautiful.And he serves it up.This is really delicious - tastes like chicken. It is chicken. It's actually about 75% cultivated chicken. The other 25% is plant-based ingredients. This blended approach may be the fastest way to get products to market, given scaling up commercial production could be a challenge. GOOD Meat's Andrew Noyes says the goal is to sell its products in the U.S. We are working actively with the FDA and USDA on an efficient pathway to market so we can sell our chicken product to consumers here. And yesterday another cultivated meat company cleared a key regulatory hurdle. The Food and Drug Administration gave Upside Foods a safety nod after reviewing more than 100 pages of documentation showing that their cultivated meat is safe to eat. It's an important first step towards selling their products in the U.S. Allison Aubrey, NPR News.(, """") ",Climate

At this year's U.N. climate conference, known as COP 27, President Biden attempted to reclaim a leadership role, and he apologized for his predecessor's pullout from the Paris Agreement. This gathering must be the moment to recommit our future and our shared capacity to write a better story for the world. Let's build on our global climate progress, raising both our ambitions and the speed of our efforts. But with the conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, now wrapping up, the question of U.S. responsibility was - still is - at issue. The countries most impacted by things like extreme heat, flooding, sea level rise - they want rich countries like the U.S. to commit to pay for damages. For more on that, we turn to national climate adviser to President Biden, Ali Zaidi. Welcome to . Thanks for having me on. Let's start with this idea of richer countries - which, of course, have contributed the most to climate change - and compensating developing countries for losses and damages they have incurred. The U.S. has said this is a great idea. We support this. But the U.S. has not come out and backed the creation of an actual pot of money to do that. Why not? You know, from Day 1 of this administration, when the president signed us back into the Paris Agreement, he came in with a very clear conviction that major economies must drive major emissions reductions. That's exactly the policy he's pursued here domestically. We're now on a path to get 50 to 52% emissions reductions by 2030. Now, at the same time, we've got to recognize that we've unleashed some of the impacts of a changing climate. And the way we tackle that has got to be together. We've got to be in partnership, in solidarity with folks all around the world. And that's why the president has been very clear. Well - and I hear you using the words partnership and solidarity. And I'm thinking, if I were from a country like, say, Pakistan that is drowning through no fault of their own - they say the U.S. keeps talking, keeps throwing these big numbers out there. But is that just kind of kicking the can down the road? What would you say to that? Yeah. As someone who was actually born in Karachi, Pakistan, I totally hear what you're saying. And one of the things that I think animates the entirety of the president's climate agenda is a focus on delivering results. That's why he's launched the Prepare Initiative, which is working to help half a billion people in developing countries respond to climate - he's deposited money, the first installment, into an adaptation fund that's designed to do just this sort of work, help broaden... But he's not - forgive me for jumping in. But, again, just back to this question of - if the U.S. thinks it's a great idea to set up a fund for losses and damages, why won't the U.S. just come out and say that and put its money where its mouth is? I think the United States has been clear that it's important for us to be a partner in supporting countries around the world, tackle the impacts of climate that have already been unleashed, that resources need to be mobilized to that end. That's why we have invested in things like the Adaptation Fund and why our Development Finance Corporation deployed $2.3 billion on climate for developing countries in just the last year. So it's a commitment. It is a recognition of the challenge. And we're fully leaned in to bringing that to bear. Can you put a number on how much money the U.S. is willing to offer for losses and damages? The president has been clear about the amount of capital we need to mobilize on climate finance - broadly, $11 billion by 2024 on an annual basis. And within that, he is focused on including 3 billion specifically on adaptation. Just one more on the question of loss and damage finance because I do want to note that the U.S. allowed that to be added to the meeting's agenda for the first time but also demanded a footnote excluding the ideas of liability for historic emitters such as the U.S. or compensation for countries affected by that pollution. To those who look at that, to what actually has just unfolded in Sharm el-Sheikh and say, I don't know; I wonder how earnest the U.S. commitment is to loss and damage compensation, what would you say? I think the United States recognizes that we are in the decisive decade for climate action. That's something that's stipulated by the science. It's being witnessed in our communities not here but all around the world. And the president's response has been strong. It's been unambiguous. And he's delivering results. As a major emitter and a major economy, we are on track now to drive down our emissions 50 to 52% by 2030. The U.S. is back at the table. And I think louder than words are the actions that we're taking. And the president is driving us forward on bold, ambitious climate action. But what about India? What about China, both of them major greenhouse gas emitters? Their leaders both skipped the conference. What's their responsibility here? I think we're seeing the president galvanize action across the world, most recently with a global MOU that we just signed into on heavy duty trucks moving to zero emissions. We're excited about the progress that we're making. And it didn't happen by accident. It happened because the president of United States decided not only are we signing back into the Paris Agreement; America is going to help us lead. Big picture, you're just back from Sharm el-Sheikh. You were there at the conference with the president. It's your job, as people are gathering, to be optimistic and search for solutions here. But you will be aware of some of the very bleak headlines coming out of the conference. The lead of my NPR colleague Nate Rott's story today from Sharm el-Sheikh reads - and I quote - ""global climate talks in Egypt are entering their final stretch. And so far, delegates have made little progress on the biggest climate questions facing humanity."" Ali Zaidi, is he right? Here's the way I look at it. I remember flying to Paris for the climate negotiations in 2015. And at that time, the world was looking at temperature rise five, six degrees, maybe more. I remember walking through the gates of the White House when President Biden took office, and the world was looking at a temperature rise of three degrees, maybe more. Now we're looking at something below two degrees. I think that's a really hopeful story. I know folks like to write climate change as a story of gloom and doom. I think it's a story of hope and opportunity. And I think Joe Biden sees that and is tapping into that power and that potential in accelerating us forward. That is national climate advisor to President Biden Ali Zaidi, just back from a big conference in Sharm el-Sheikh. Thank you so much. Thank you - appreciate it.(, """") ",Climate

Bronte Wittpenn/Bloomberg via Getty hide caption, A methane flare seen in Texas. Methane is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas that is currently released in huge quantities by oil and gas operations, landfills and agriculture., -SHEIKH, Egypt – Global climate talks in Egypt are entering their final stretch, and so far, delegates have made little progress on the biggest climate questions facing humanity., Global greenhouse gas emissions are still rising. The Earth is on track to blow past temperature targets that could rein in the most extreme weather events. And the countries most vulnerable to climate-driven disasters are still largely on their own to pay for catastrophic damage., Now, negotiators are entering the most intense period of the two-week meeting, known as COP27. Talks are supposed to wrap up on Friday. But those who have attended past annual meetings say it's likely that delegates will miss that deadline, given their many areas of disagreement., ""The Parties remain divided on a number of significant issues,"" said United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, in a speech Thursday. ""There is clearly a breakdown in trust between North and South, and between developed and emerging economies."", The main sticking point in negotiations centers on the issue of loss and damage – the question of what developed countries, which contributed the most to climate change, owe to smaller, developing countries, which are suffering its effects now. Vulnerable countries have been asking for a fund to be set up that would provide them with money in the wake of a climate-fueled disaster like the flooding in Pakistan earlier this year., Multiple countries and climate advocates have described the establishment of a fund as being the ""litmus test"" for a successful climate conference., ""This would be a failed COP if there's no fund,"" said Kathy Jetn̄il-Kijiner, Climate Envoy for the Marshall Islands. ""Continuously delaying the process because people can't agree or see the value in it, that's really difficult for us."", The world's largest historic polluter, the United States, has been stalling conversations about loss and damage, climate advocates and negotiators tell NPR. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry seemed to address growing frustrations during a press event about methane reductions on Thursday., Seventeen of the 20 countries in the world most affected by climate change are in Africa, Kerry said. Collectively, they've contributed roughly 0.55% of all emissions warming the world., ""It's no wonder that there's an increasing anger, an increasing frustration, which we intend to address here while we're in Sharm El-Sheikh,"" he said., Vulnerable countries have very little power to affect what rich countries do, shy of walking out on negotiations, which negotiators say is unlikely., Despite the disagreement on loss and damage, there have been some areas of agreement heading into the final negotiations. One hundred and fifty countries have now signed on to reduce emissions of methane by one third by the end of the decade. Methane is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas that is currently released in huge quantities by oil and gas operations, landfills and agriculture., Kerry said clamping down on methane emissions is key if humans hope to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius – the goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement and a level at which some of the worst climate disasters might be avoided. Right now, the Earth is on track to hit nearly 3 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century., ""This is absolutely critical to our ability to keep 1.5 degrees [Celsius] within reach,"" he said. ""As you hear some of the grim predictions about where we are with respect to 1.5 [degrees], methane looms even more and more important."", China has not agreed to reduce its methane emissions, despite being home to some of the largest sources of methane pollution. But on Thursday, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua made a surprise appearance at Kerry's press conference about methane, and said the Chinese government is working on a plan to address that., The United Nations also announced a new plan to beef up global weather forecasts to warn people about impending disasters, especially in lower-income countries where early warning systems are often lacking. And there has been some progress toward funding the transition to clean electricity in rapidly developing countries like Indonesia, which is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions., Still, overall progress to address global warming and pay for its effects is looking grim. Scientists say greenhouse gas emissions must be cut in half this decade to avoid runaway sea level rise, deadly heat waves, mass extinction of animals and plants and a variety of weather disasters. Right now, countries have collectively promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions by only about 3% by 2030.",Climate

Tyrone Turner hide caption, A view of the glaciers and mountains from the Gerlache Strait on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula in February 2022., As frigid wind whipped across the ship's bow, I held the railing with one hand and steadied my camera with the other. In front of me stretched the Bellingshausen Sea, off the coast of Western Antarctica. I was there — my second journey to the region around the southernmost continent — early this year on a five-week voyage as a photographic expert aboard the National Geographic Endurance. A small group of passengers and I stood on the deck together, wrapped up tightly against the below-freezing temperatures, documenting this otherworldly landscape., Pancakes of sea ice covered the waters as far as the eye could see. A lone emperor penguin tucked its head into its chest of feathers. As we sailed past seals resting on the ice, they raised their heads and promptly slid into the water.

As the last ice age in North America retreated more than 12,000 years ago, melting glacial runoff carved out the Mississippi River basin. For thousands of years after that, the seasonal unfettered flooding of the Mississippi deposited sediment in the low delta region and built up the southern part of the state. Starting in the late 19th century, Congress tasked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with building levees to control the river to improve navigation and provide for flood protection. Paradoxically, what seemed good for urban expansion and industrialization along the Mississippi River gradually starved the wetlands of the sediment needed to rebuild and counteract natural subsidence., (Top image) A May 2006 aerial view of marshlands near Empire, La.

Tyrone Turner hide caption, Antarctica and Louisiana share a history of extractive industries in search of fuel. At the same time the Corps was beginning its work on the Mississippi, Antarctic whales were being hunted for the oil extracted from their blubber. Over the following century, commercial whaling expanded to such an extent that several species were nearly killed off., In the 20th century, the oil and gas industry carved up Louisiana's coastal marshes with thousands of exploration canals, accelerating erosion. The combination of levees, canals and natural subsidence all contributed to coastal land loss and reduced critical protection against hurricane storm surges. Presently, the state loses a football field's worth of land every 100 minutes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey., The warming climate is affecting the polar regions, especially in the Arctic. However, runoff from Antarctic ice currently makes up 20-25% of global sea level rise. And warming and expanding oceans will only accelerate the glacial ice sheets' decay. As sea levels rise, scientists predict low-lying coastal areas around the world will increasingly be overwhelmed. This is true for my home state, where wetlands are the primary defense against storm surges. And levees alone will not hold back the rising waters., (Top image) A king penguin colony on the South Georgia Island's in February 2022.

https://www.npr.org/2022/11/17/1137334846/the-crucial-need-for-energy-storage-is-key-to-the-future-of-clean-energy,2022-11-17,The crucial need for energy storage is key to the future of clean energy,,"Let's get a picture of a carbon-neutral future. The U.S. is trying to change its electricity sources to produce fewer of the gases that contribute to climate change. The fight over the climate has been a partisan issue, but beyond that, it's simply a practical problem. How do you get power from cleaner sources? In earlier days on this program, we've heard about nuclear power and wind power. The next question is how to store energy from renewable sources, like wind and solar. George Crabtree is the director of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research and an expert on batteries. The lithium-ion battery that we have now can discharge at full power for about four hours. And that's great for intraday needs - passing clouds, gusty winds - even for extending, let's say, solar power past sunset by a few hours, and that's when there's a huge demand peak. But it cannot do, let's say, consecutive days that are overcast or that are calm. So you need a different battery for that. It won't be lithium ion. That's one of the technological breakthroughs that we're looking for, often called long-duration storage. And even aside from the duration, there's the sheer number. I'm imagining you must need, like, giant warehouses full of batteries, millions of batteries. The warehouse of batteries is exactly what is deployed next to every solar farm. And if you see them, it looks like a huge parking garage. It really takes up space. Luckily for the electricity grid, they don't have to be located in cities. They can be out where the solar farm or the wind farm is. And that's a huge advantage. So the fact that it takes up a lot of space isn't really the biggest challenge. Are there things other than batteries that can be used to store energy? There are. So things like hydrogen, which is getting a lot of play now. You could burn hydrogen in a gas turbine to produce electricity. You could use hydrogen in fuel cells that produce electricity without combustion, still a chemical reaction. Or you could simply use hydrogen to create ammonia, NH3, which is another liquid, as opposed to gaseous, chemical storage medium that people talk about. I've heard people talk about using gravity as a storage device. Would you explain how that would work? Sure. So the gravity storage, it's sometimes called, is just another form of hydroelectric storage. So you pump water uphill when you've got extra electricity. You let it flow downhill through a generator when you need the electricity. And that is actually incredibly versatile. Most of the storage we have on the grid now is pumped hydro. So although there's plenty of hydro out there now, it's not considered to be viable for the many, many storage applications on the grid that are to come. Is there some other form of gravity storage that would make sense that doesn't involve water? Sure. So you can - it works with anything that has weight. So you can lift concrete blocks with a big crane that might be half as tall as a skyscraper. And when you have extra electricity, you turn a generator, which lifts the concrete block up. When you want it back, you let the concrete block down slowly and generate electricity. I'm enjoying that because in junior high school science class, I learned about potential energy and kinetic energy. That pile of concrete blocks is potential energy sitting there, right? Exactly. And thanks for bringing it up. That's the way we talk about it. Let me ask, though, if you think that these various solutions for energy storage could be done on such a massive scale that we could do without fossil fuels for our basic electricity generation, the stuff that comes into my house. Yeah, great question. So the experts say that we could probably convert the grid 80% to renewable - that's wind and solar - without having to deal with this long-duration storage problem. We'd still use gas peaker plants for that. But that would only be for 20% of the electricity that we need. If you want to do the other 20%, you're going to have to solve that problem of storage, you know, long-term storage for the grid, days in a row. And you could do that with gravity storage. You could do that with a chemical energy carrier. It's done with methane now. So we got to get rid of the methane. But you could have hydrogen or ammonia or another chemical energy medium which is yet to be discovered. That's the challenge. We can get to 80%, but we can't get to 100%. Wow. Well, that leads to another question. People who are anxious about adaptation to climate change will ask, am I going to be forced to change my life in some way, to consume less, to use less electricity? Would people, in your imagination at least, have to change their lives in some way to get to a carbon-neutral electric grid? Yeah. And I think it's - you used the word have to change. It may be that it's not a choice. We're going to go to EVs, for example, and the vision is that we'll have 100% EVs by some date - 2035, 2050. And that will change the way that we drive. Our driving habits will not be the same. We haven't gotten serious about those cultural changes and lifestyle changes yet. We haven't had to. But I think they will come, for sure. When you see reports that say we need to make dramatic progress in terms of carbon emissions in the next 10 to 20 years, are you at all optimistic? Well, that's a good question. I think you hear a lot of pessimism in the country, and the pessimism is growing simply because the severe weather is growing. It's pretty hard to miss. But the place where the pessimism is maybe the strongest is the younger generations, the Gen Zs and the millennials, who will inherit the world, the climate change world that we older folks are leaving to them. And they're not happy about it. The young people are going to take it much more seriously, I think, than the older generations, and they're going to demand action. So in that sense, I would say there's optimism. I think you were asking, though, about - can we do it in 10 years? Yeah. We're not on track. That's clear. The United States has, through the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act, have put some money on the table to change that, at least in the United States. It's a bit controversial. But I would say for the first time, the government is taking it seriously. And that can be a dramatic, let's say, influence on the rest of the world. It's a global problem, for sure. It cannot be solved in any one country. All the countries have to get together to make the commitment. And maybe we're making some progress to that. Clearly, we're not there yet. George Crabtree of the Argonne National Laboratory and the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research. Thanks so much. Thank you. We're storing up some knowledge here, and we'll continue our talks on America's energy transition tomorrow. ",Climate

Then a wildfire burned near his home. Eli Imadali hide caption, When he was younger, climate change felt like an abstract concept to Gabriel Nagel. Then a wildfire burned near his home., Do you know a kid who is learning about climate change? We made a comic about how it's changing the planet and how to deal with the big feelings you might have when you hear about it., Climate change didn't seem urgent to Gabriel Nagel when he was a kid. In a seventh grade class, he saw the chart showing global carbon emissions rising, but it felt abstract., Then in 2017, a wildfire burned within a few blocks of his house in Boulder, Colorado., ""That was a moment when it kind of clicked for me that climate change isn't something of the future,"" Nagel says. ""It's something that we're dealing with right now, and no matter who you are, you're going to be impacted."", Kids across the world are increasingly facing the impacts of climate change, from losing homes in disasters to having recess canceled due to extreme heat waves. Climate anxiety is on the rise, as a younger generation confronts inheriting a much hotter world., ""Many young people are experiencing grief and frustration and anxiety and elements of betrayal by adults and other generations,"" says Dr. Kelsey Hudson, a clinical psychologist who specializes in climate change., In coping with those feelings, many young people are figuring out ways to find meaning and purpose. Here's some of their advice., Nagel and his family evacuated during the wildfire in Boulder, Colorado, but luckily his house came out unscathed. After that, he began noticing how wildfires seemed to be happening more often across the West, especially with the long-running drought., ""I know other people through not just that fire, but other fires across Colorado who have lost their homes,"" he says., Nagel started learning more about climate change and began taking action in his daily life, like biking more and eating less meat. But it was joining the sustainability club at his high school in Denver that made the biggest difference. There, he met other students working to help their community, like planting trees and encouraging his school to start composting, He also joined another student group, DPS Students for Climate Action. Over the course of almost two years, the group pushed Denver Public Schools to pass its first climate policy, adopting goals to reduce emissions and use clean energy district-wide., ""Being surrounded by people who are equally passionate and have the same amount of optimism about the future can be really uplifting and kind of motivating,"" he says., When he feels overwhelmed by the future of the planet, he meets up with a friend, Mariah Rosensweig, whom he got to know through the sustainability club. They go on walks and hikes together, venting about whatever is on their minds., ""It sometimes feels like what I'm doing will never be enough,"" Nagel says. ""And part of that is true. Like one person isn't going to be able to change the fate of this planet, of climate change. But I think at the same time, I also do have hope that by working together, we can actually resolve this crisis."", As a kid, Rosensweig's deep love of nature grew from being outdoors all the time., ""I was always one of the few girls that would be dirtier than all the boys,"" Rosensweig says. ""My grandpa nicknamed me the 'tree panther,' because I would always be in a tree and he wouldn't know where I was."", In high school, she became a beekeeper. For her, working on climate change is about reminding people of their connection to the natural world. But seeing the damage to the natural world can be disheartening., Mariah Rosensweig knows that seeing the effects of climate change can be disheartening. To combat those feelings, Rosenweig gets outside and connects with her senses and natural the world. Violet Baker hide caption, ""Now the conversation isn't: what can we do to prevent climate change?"" she says. ""It's: how are we going to live with it? As I'm still so young, to hear that shift is frustrating because it's like – we've known about this for so long."", When she feels that way, Rosensweig says it's simple: go outside., ""I'll sit myself down on the ground and really connect to my senses, especially breath,"" she says. ""That will make you more aware of the world around you. And then the more that you're aware, the more you're going to care. The more you care, the more likely you are to do something about it."", When 15-year-old Tanish Doshi first moved to Tuscon, Arizona, the extreme heat was a shock, especially as rising summer temperatures broke records year after year., ""It feels like your skin is on fire,"" he says. ""A lot of people have access to safe places to stay, to air conditioning, to water, stuff like that. When you look at our unhoused populations and different people, they don't have that access a lot of the time here in southern Arizona. So the heat is really, really bad."", When climate change seems daunting, Doshi's advice is to find someone who cares about it and ask how to help in your community., When Tucson's Habitat for Humanity office was hit with flooding during heavy monsoon rains, Doshi rallied his friends to do something. They designed a flood control system around the building, putting in drainage pipes, holding basins and rerouting water to absorbent areas with plants. Around 20 people helped out with construction, including his nine-year-old brother., ""For me, advocacy and action has alleviated some of my climate anxiety because it shows me success is possible, right?"" he says. ""If a group of teenagers here in Tucson can have this success and if teenagers across the country are having similar success, that can really lead to reforms on the national level."", Helping out in your community doesn't need to be a big project, psychologists like Hudson say. It can be as simple as planting a pollinator-friendly flower. The key thing is to find meaning in the action and build social connections in the process., ""We can think about: what does it look like for young people to find a sense of meaning and purpose in this crisis?"" Hudson says. ""Connect with like-minded others and build some agency through connecting with climate engagement or action."", When Sabal Dangi was 11 years old, he took a trip to Nepal where his family is originally from. He saw how vulnerable people are to climate impacts, like hotter temperatures that are making water supplies more unreliable., ""We would see how climate change is really affecting them at those high altitudes,"" he says. ""They use all of their water from all the glacier melt and the Himalayas. And so now they're really trying to adapt and conserve."", Dangi was homing in on something that resonates with many young people: the global inequality of climate change. Extreme storms, floods and droughts can be more devastating in lower-income countries where people have few safety nets., ""Last year, my climate anxiety started really getting to its peak,"" he says. ""It was just the feeling of not being able to do something."", Dangi, now 16, wasn't sure he knew enough about climate change to get involved. But after going to a few climate protests, he started a Fridays for Future chapter where he lives in Fresno, California. The youth-led movement has chapters around the world that lead climate strikes, where students walk out of school or protest after school., At first, it was just Dangi and a couple friends, but the group grew in size the more he kept at it. Discussing and engaging people about climate issues has helped him feel more positive., ""You don't have to have a fancy degree or something to really speak out about the planet,"" Dangi says. ""The world is everybody's home. It's everybody's future. And it's something everybody can really stand up for and speak out about.""",Climate

They're unlikely to get it.,Michael Copley,"Climate activists at the United Nations climate conference in Egypt call for money to pay for loss and damage from global warming in low-income countries. Peter Dejong/AP hide caption, Climate activists at the United Nations climate conference in Egypt call for money to pay for loss and damage from global warming in low-income countries., Facing mounting pressure to compensate low-income countries for damages they're suffering from climate change, wealthy nations may try to move money they've already promised to other global warming goals rather than come up with new funding, according to experts and participants at the United Nations climate conference in Egypt., A draft document released this week at the talks says money for loss and damage — a key issue in the negotiations — should be added to climate financing that's already going to low-income countries to help them limit and adapt to global warming. The current funding arrangement, which was created more than a decade ago, reflects the fact that industrialized nations such as the United States have emitted most of the pollution heating the Earth, while poorer countries are bearing the brunt of the harm caused by rising temperatures., But industrialized countries for years have failed to fully fund those pledges. That makes the odds slim for a big new cash infusion for loss and damage, especially as countries deal with the threat of recession and the war in Ukraine. And it's raising the possibility that developed nations will now look to transfer money from older financing commitments to potentially new loss and damage obligations, without actually increasing overall funds that low-income nations need to cope with climate change., ""We do need to see money, extra money, flow towards"" loss and damage, says Michai Robertson, an advisor to the Alliance of Small Island States, which represents communities that are especially vulnerable to climate change. However, he says that a reshuffling of climate funds is likely to be ""a reality that we're gonna have to contend with a lot going forward."", Failure to deliver new money for loss and damage would mean that richer countries would continue their chronic underfunding of developing nations. That's heightening fears that this year's climate conference won't galvanize a strong global response to climate change despite the urgency signaled by deadly events across the world., One of the challenges of dealing with climate change is that countries have to do several things at once to protect their people, experts say. Countries need to limit, or mitigate, further warming. They need to adapt to risks people are facing. And they need to compensate poorer nations for damage already done and for impacts that can't be avoided, like communities being displaced by rising seas. All that takes funding, which, given the scope of the problem, should increase over time., So far, several countries have pledged money for loss and damage. But the amounts are relatively small, and the money isn't new, says Taylor Dimsdale, a director at E3G, a climate change think tank. Rather, countries are ""just dividing the same climate finance pie up in different ways."", If money is pulled away from mitigation and adaptation efforts, it could mean that more places and people will experience irrevocable losses and damage., Over time, the amount of money that's available to low-income countries will probably grow, so that claims for loss and damage don't eat into funding for adaptation to extreme weather, says Gaia Larsen, director of climate finance access and deployment at the World Resources Institute's Sustainable Finance Center. But right now, ""developed countries are pushing back, mostly because they don't want to provide a lot more money,"" she says., Reached for comment, a spokesperson for John Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate change, pointed to recent comments in which Kerry said the country ""has been very clear about its support to deal with the loss and damage issue."", It's still unclear, though, what sort of action world leaders would be willing to commit to in Egypt., Frans Timmermans, executive vice president of the European Commission, suggested on Wednesday that a decision on whether to create a new fund or financial mechanism for addressing loss and damage should be delayed while details are worked out, including whether certain developing countries like China should contribute and how money would be distributed. China is the world's largest emitter of heat-trapping pollution and the second-biggest economy., ""Now, we believe that a process should be started where the [financial] facility could be one of the outcomes,"" Timmermans said in Egypt. ""But we also believe that the existing instruments we have could be mobilized immediately to support the most vulnerable."", The European Union and several member states said Wednesday that they're providing more than 1 billion euros ($1.04 billion) of new and existing funds for adaptation programs in Africa. An EU spokesperson said the bloc is contributing 220 million euros of new funding, including 60 million euros for loss and damage., ""So you see that we have tools, funds, mechanisms to deliver financial assistance now and to move it quickly,"" Timmermans said., Kaveh Guilanpour, vice president of international strategies at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, says there could be ""good reasons"" to hold off on creating a new fund for loss and damage at this year's climate conference., It isn't clear whether such a fund would ""rapidly result in the flow of new finance,"" Guilanpour says. And world leaders are looking for ways to use limited public money to attract other forms of financing, he says, including from the private sector., Guilanpour says climate litigation along with better attribution science linking extreme weather events to climate change could expose fossil fuel companies to greater liability for the impacts of rising temperatures. That could provide a valuable source of funding for loss and damage claims., ""There is a willingness and there's a recognition [among industrialized countries] that more finance is needed for loss and damage,"" Guilanpour says. ""But I think there's also a question about where and how is the money going to come from."", Developing countries are also looking for safeguards to ensure they get whatever they're promised., Even if world leaders decide this week to create a new loss and damage fund, ""we're gonna still have the blurring of the lines and the rebranding that you see a lot of developed countries doing right now,"" says Robertson of the Alliance of Small Island States., ""We're gonna need to make sure to establish some clear rules on this and what can count as funding towards this cause,"" Robertson says, ""especially to keep them accountable.""",Climate

From member station KQED, Kevin Stark reports. You can think of this plan as a roadmap for how California could essentially zero out greenhouse gas emissions in a little more than two decades. The plan calls for slashing emissions by 48% by 2030 based on 1990 levels. Energy analysts say that's a more aggressive target than what President Biden's proposed for the country. Lauren Sanchez is climate adviser to Governor Gavin Newsom. This plan will indeed be very difficult to achieve because of the scale of the task and the speed with which it needs to be delivered. But the governor will not take failure as an option, and neither should any of us. Newsom pushed the state's Air Resources Board to move faster after it released a draft plan earlier this year. Included in the latest version is the state's mandate to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars. He also worked with the legislative leaders to pass a broad climate package that included the legislation to achieve carbon neutrality. If realized, California's climate plan could transform daily life in the nation's most populous state. Tens of millions of electric cars would have to be added to the roads. And even with that, many more Californians would need to use public transit than do now. Seven million existing homes and commercial buildings that use fuel for heating and cooking would have to switch to electric in a little more than a decade.The backbone of the plan is a cleaner, more robust power grid. It includes a commitment to stop building gas power plants, quadruple wind and solar generation, all while doubling the state's capacity to produce electricity. That won't be easy. The state narrowly avoided rolling blackouts this year after demand nearly surpassed supply during a heat wave that baked the state for 10 days. Liane Randolph is the state's top air regulator. We need to take action to reduce the worst impacts of a changing climate. And there is only one way to do that - break forever our dependence on fossil fuels, the harsh grip of petroleum and move as fast as we can to a clean-energy economy. Randolph says this plan could drive the state's economy forward, creating an estimated 4 million jobs and address one of the state's persistent environmental problems - punishing smog. And by rapidly shifting away from fossil fuels, the plan delivers public health benefits to everyone in California and most importantly, to those communities suffering from persistent air pollution. The state estimates it would cut air pollution by 71% and save Californians $200 billion in health care costs due to pollution.For NPR News, I'm Kevin Stark in San Francisco. ",Climate
https://www.npr.org/2022/11/16/1134823038/climate-change-migration-senegal-africa-environment,2022-11-16,What a lettuce farm in Senegal reveals about climate-driven migration in Africa,"Ari Shapiro, Noah Caldwell, Ayen Bior, Matt Ozug, Sarah Handel, RICCI SHRYOCK","When you start drawing a map of where people move because of climate change, the arrows can go in a lot of different directions. Take Senegal. For the last several days, we've been telling stories of Senegalese people who are leaving their home country because of climate change. But unpredictable weather patterns across Africa are also sending people to Senegal. I cannot give an exact number of people, but I can say it's increasing. It's a sweltering hot day, and Ousmane Diop is leading us through a field of lettuce, or, as they call it here... ...What we call salad. Salad? English, here - salad. Yeah, yeah. Diop works with the International Organization for Migration, or IOM. They help people from all over West Africa who arrive in Senegal. Many come here just outside of Dakar to a city called Rufisque to labor in the fields, planting seeds and harvesting vegetables. So some of them come from Gambia, from Mali, some Senegalese from the inland. From the inland - Senegalese people are also migrating internally to places like this, where farms are more productive. A cement factory looms over us. Trucks rumble by on a road that cuts right through the fields, a reminder of how quickly the outskirts of Dakar are crowding in on these farms.So we're arriving under a great big fiddle-leaf fig tree, and in the shade, there are large tires that people are sitting on, chairs and little stools made out of small branches.About a dozen men take shelter from the heat. At the foot of the tree, there's a hut with walls of corrugated metal. The men outside, laughing, give us permission to enter. #1: You have authorization? We have authorization.It has a simple sleeping pallet inside.There are bags hanging from hooks on the wall. It's cozy and dark. It's very cool. Yeah. Yeah.The men sleep here sometimes so they can water the fields at night when it won't evaporate as quickly. Today, a sprinkler is doing some of the work for them. Swarms of dragonflies hover over the neat green rows of lettuce. None of the men in this small group are from Senegal. All of them grew up working the fields in their home countries. But those farms are no longer producing like they used to. Rains are unpredictable. Crops don't grow. (Through interpreter) Here in Senegal, the way they grow all this food, if you could have that in the neighboring countries, young people wouldn't go abroad. Fode Balde is 30. He grew up on a farm in The Gambia. (Through interpreter) The rainy season was really bad in the last few years. Do you mean the rains did not come or there was too much? What happened? (Through interpreter) I noticed a big difference between before and nowadays. Nowadays, the rain is really rare. Does Senegal feel like home now? (Through interpreter) Yeah, it really does. So you think you will stay here? (Through interpreter) Yeah. We all talk about this. We have hope. Sitting next to him, Sadio Konte is from Mali. He wears a black baseball cap that says Dior. (Speaking Bambara). He speaks in Bambara, which we translate into Wolof, then to English. He says the deserts in Mali are advancing. (Speaking Bambara). It's so much hotter where he's from in Mali, he says, which makes farming difficult. And he thanks God that he found work here.The changes that these men observe are consistent with what scientists have predicted would happen in Africa as the Earth heats up. Most of the migration in Africa looks like this. According to the U.N., 80% of migrants stay on the continent instead of going on to Europe. And these men immigrated here legally. They have freedom to move across borders within West Africa in the same way citizens of the European Union can cross EU borders freely. Farmers and herders have always migrated following weather patterns. But walking through the lettuce fields, Ousmane Diop of the IOM tells me things are different now. Seventy percent of people here in Africa, in West Africa, do the agriculture. And agriculture depend integrally in climate condition. So that's why, with the impact of climate change, migration is a coping strategy. A coping strategy - faced with dramatic changes in weather, people are coming up with their own solutions to support their families without crossing oceans, without risking their lives to reach countries that colonized them in the past. The Muslim call to prayer rings out from a mosque behind us. Some of the farm workers roll out prayer rugs and kneel.Seydu Balde is 29. He came here in 2015, also from The Gambia. Growing up, he knew exactly how to grow vegetables like the lettuce that he plants here. But now... You know, sometimes the rainy season - we experience a lot of problems. Here's one of those problems. At the beginning of the rainy season, you plant seeds which germinate. But those seeds need more rain. So if there's an unexpected dry patch... Those seeds that's germinated, they will end up dying. So you have to plant an entirely new crop. You have to replant again while the season is going on. And the rainy season is short, just three months. So losing time can be devastating. Example - if it's supposed to weight 10 kilos, it will be weighting 5 kilos instead of 10. So you're getting half the harvest that you usually get. It will be very light because the production will be very poor. It will be very bad. He would grow peanuts, corn, millet. Eventually, bringing in half as much harvest as he used to, he couldn't keep up. So he left. And when he visits home, he tells other young men that they should leave, too. I tell them, if there is no work, you need to move out. Because, like, if you don't work, you end up stealing. Because right now, if you are caught stealing and you are jailed for two years, that's a waste of time. Does it make you sad to not be in your home country? Actually, there's no place like home. No matter what, I feel to be home. There is no place like home. These men wish they didn't have to find a new home. But for now, the lettuce is growing, and it needs to be picked. The midday break is over, and it's time for these men from all over West Africa to return to their fields in Senegal. Although this kind of regional migration within Africa is much more common, longer journeys to Europe are more dangerous, more politically provocative, and they get more attention. That's why Europe is fortifying its borders with Africa. On the northern edge of the African continent are two Spanish cities surrounded by fences, guarded by men with guns. People have died trying to jump those barriers. As our reporting continues this week, we'll visit that land border where Africa meets Europe. #2: (Through interpreter) Melilla today is like a bunker. It's like living in an island. Melilla is somehow a gate into Europe. ","NA"

G-20 leaders are trying to reach consensus on how to tackle climate change and national debts and food security - or lack thereof - even as war in Ukraine has disrupted food shipments, including shipments to Indonesia. NPR's Emily Feng is in Bali for us today. Hey there, Emily. Hi, Mary Louise. Flesh out this agenda bit for us because it sounds like a lot. It is. And on top of world hunger and war that leaders are grappling with, a lot of the agenda was actually overshadowed at first by this highly anticipated meeting between President Biden and China's leader Xi Jinping - these leaders of two competing superpowers that are trying to avoid a second Cold War. Yeah. And the meeting last night actually appeared to be a modest success, so that's good, with both men appearing open to improving the relationship. But this is just the beginning. And today, there was more work. President Biden and leaders from other countries are working on securing commitments on clean energy and climate to make sure that the world meets its climate goals as previously agreed to by world leaders and does not overheat the globe by too much. Stay with those climate commitments for a sec. Was there anything concrete - any agreement on that? Well, what's new today is the U.S., Japan and Indonesia announced a partnership. They're going to invest millions of dollars into clean energy infrastructure - mainly electric vehicle development in Indonesia. And Europe and the U.S. are funding these smaller projects in public health, from India to the Honduras. And this is part of a bigger push ongoing with partners like the European Union to build clean infrastructure and public health programs. And it's designed in part to compete with China's own global infrastructure push called the Belt and Road Initiative, which, over about the last nearly decade, has spent huge amounts across the developing world. And it's all part and parcel of Biden's effort to rally American allies in the region and beyond and strengthen those relationships - and, again, here it comes back to China - so the U.S. can fortify its presence here in the Pacific in case tensions with China do rise. OK. Let me turn you to the war in Ukraine and the ongoing challenge we mentioned of getting grain shipments out of Ukraine. Russia has been blockading those - any progress there? Not yet because G-20 has been overshadowed by the fact that the two men at the heart of this conflict, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia's Vladimir Putin, did not show up to G-20. There had been this faint hope they might come and find some way to broker peace. But in their absence, Zelenskyy instead gave a video speech today. He had just finished a trip to the Ukrainian city of Kherson, newly liberated from Russian control. And in his video speech to the G-20, he pushed back against any potential negotiation with Russia. He basically said that Ukraine would continue fighting, especially when he thought there was a good chance of total victory now.But in general, Russia's invasion has really divided the countries that are present here at the G-20. The U.S. and Europe are pushing really hard to get other countries to condemn the invasion, but not all of them want to, including Indonesia, the host country. So that's quite awkward. And right before the summit, there was this question of - will there be any agreement at all? Can they put out a joint declaration at the end? But I was able to see a draft version of the declaration here that so far has been approved by all 20 participants, including Russia. And it contains a reference to the, quote, ""war in Ukraine,"" but it's been worded in a way to show that there was significant pushback to condemn that, showing once again that this war has split the world in a way that could not be bridged this time by dialogue. NPR's Emily Feng getting us up to speed on what is happening with the G-20 meetings underway in Indonesia. Thank you, Emily. Thank you, Mary Louise. ",Climate

The United Nations is celebrating today as the day of 8 billion, the first time the global population has hit that mark. Humans are living longer because of advances in public health and nutrition, but they're also putting an unprecedented strain on our planet. We're going to go now to what may soon become the world's most populous country, India. Our correspondent Lauren Frayer is based in the biggest city there, Mumbai. Hey, Lauren. Hi, Ailsa. So where was that baby born today? So it's impossible to know. It's kind of a symbolic thing. But experts say that baby, he or she, is likely born today in the global south, probably in a city like where I am. I'm in a city of many more than 20 million people - we don't actually know - Mumbai. You might hear the cacophony of traffic behind me. And cities like mine are becoming the norm in places like India. India has had the biggest population growth in real numbers. Next year, it will overtake China or is forecast to do this as the world's most populous country. Both countries are right around 1.4 billion people. But China's population has already stabilized and will probably reach a peak next year, according to some estimates. India's growth is slowing, too, not because it's had a one-child policy like China did, India has not. But it's seeing declining birth rates due to rising female education, family planning and rapid migrations to cities like mine. And so India is stabilizing, too. And actually, the U.N. sees the fastest population growth in sub-Saharan Africa. And what's driving this burgeoning population? Like, what factors contribute to population growth or decline? Yeah. So populations grow when there's less war, famine, less humanitarian catastrophe, but also when people have access to health care and medicine. And so that's why the U.N. is celebrating today. I spoke with Andrea Wojnar. She's the India representative for the U.N. Population Fund, and she calls this a triumph of human development. The number of human beings is more than ever due to increasing life expectancy, but also declining infant and maternal mortality. So for us, that's a mark of progress in medicine and in health systems. So this is a landmark in human survival. But, you know, populations also grow when there's a lack of family planning and a lack of education and empowerment of women. And so won't Wojnar and her U.N. organization say that's something to work on for countries where population growth is high. And then what are the specific challenges associated with population growth? I imagine that there's an impact when it comes to climate change, right? Yeah. So population growth can be a strain on resources. Slower growth can help mitigate environmental degradation. But population growth is also concentrated primarily in poorer countries that happen to have lower emissions. So U.N. says actually, the bigger threat to the environment is consumption in Western developed countries, where populations are stable or even declining. I mean, the average American has a much larger carbon footprint than the average Indian. And yet Indians suffer the effects of climate change disproportionately.I want to mention that some demographers are actually excited about this population growth because of what they call demographic dividends. So whereas China and much of the developed world have aging populations and, you know, increasingly smaller workforces, India is one of the best examples of a population with a huge youth bulge. So a huge working age population, ages roughly 15 to 29, that can help fuel economic development and growth and lift millions more out of poverty. So the question is whether India, you know, can invest in infrastructure in order to take advantage of these dividends and maximize its human potential. And, you know, we're just going to have to wait and see. That is NPR's Lauren Frayer in Mumbai. Thank you so much, Lauren. Thanks for having me. ",World

Upside Foods is one of the biggest companies in the cultivated meats space, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars to continue research and development. Brian L. Frank for NPR hide caption, Upside Foods CEO, Uma Valeti. Upside Foods is one of the biggest companies in the cultivated meats space, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars to continue research and development., The Food and Drug Administration has taken a first step towards allowing the sale of cultivated ""no kill"" meat in the U.S, giving a safety nod to Upside Foods, a San Francisco based start-up. The company produces meat grown from animal cells, without slaughtering the animal., ""The world is experiencing a food revolution and the FDA is committed to supporting innovation in the food supply,"" wrote FDA Commissioner Robert Califf and director the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Susan Mayne., The FDA reviewed more than 100 pages of documentation from Upside Foods, and has now completed its pre-market consultation. The agency says it ""has no further questions"" about the firm's conclusion that the products are safe to eat. This removes a key regulatory hurdle and could bring Upside Foods one step closer to selling its products in the U.S. The next steps are to work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on labeling and inspection., Upside Foods was co-founded by Uma Valeti, a cardiologist who dreamt of producing meat in a different way. Instead of raising livestock on farms and killing them in slaughterhouses, Valeti wanted to find a way to ""grow"" meat in a production facility, by culturing animal cells., The concept for what's now called ""cultivated"" meat came to Valeti when he was working with heart attack patients at the Mayo Clinic more than 15 years ago, growing human heart cells in a lab. It should be possible to grow meat with similar science, he realized., Scientists could extract cells from an animal via a needle biopsy, place them in tanks, feed them the nutrients they need to proliferate, including fats, sugar, amino acids and vitamins, and end up with meat., It has taken years of experimentation by a crew of biologists, biochemists and engineers to turn that concept into a product ready to eat. ""People said it was science fiction,"" Valeti told me as we toured the company's new 70,000-square-foot facility. If it gets a greenlight to start selling its meat, Upside's production facility in Emeryville, Calif., will be able to produce over 50,000 pounds of cultivated meat products per year. ""This is real,"" Valeti says., We suited up for the tour in gowns, goggles and hair nets to maintain food safety protocols and walked past shiny, brewery-style, stainless steel tanks reaching from floor to ceiling., The lobby at Upside Foods is a dining area where one can see meat being produced through windows in a wall. Brian L. Frank for NPR hide caption, The lobby at Upside Foods is a dining area where one can see meat being produced through windows in a wall., But these tanks — called cultivators in this industry — ""brew"" meat, not beer. We saw the cell bank where the animal cell samples are stored, the pipes that pump nutrients into the tanks, and finally the raw meat as it emerged from the production facility., The process had a futuristic vibe but by the end of the tour, it felt somehow ordinary to me — like a kind of hydroponic gardening., The facility's glass walls look out into a busy upscale neighborhood, filled with restaurants, apartments and offices. Valeti says the glass walls are intentional — to signal transparency. ""To create a paradigm change, people should be able to walk through and see and believe it,"" he says., Upside Foods could have lots of competition once cultivated meats enter the market. More than 80 companies are staking a future in the space. For instance, Good Meat, part of Eat Just, Inc., will serve its cultivated chicken at the COP-27 climate conference this week, after debuting its product in Singapore. Also, Sci-Fi Foods, founded by self-proclaimed ""burger-obsessed food lovers"" aims to blend cultivated beef with a plant-based recipe to produce a hybrid burger that, they say, will be better for the planet., The cultivation room at Upside Foods. David Kay hide caption, The cultivation room at Upside Foods., The acceleration in investment comes as more consumers connect the dots between what they eat and the environment. An estimated one third of all human-induced greenhouse gas emissions come from food production and scientists warn it's nearly impossible to meet climate goals without changing agriculture., Scientists say beef has an especially large environmental impact because it requires a lot of land to graze animals and is a leading source of methane emissions. By comparison, it takes much less land and grain to raise chickens. However, concentrated poultry operations are linked to water pollution., Furthermore, concentrated animal feeding operations are a risk factor for the emergence of diseases that spread between animals and people, as a U.N. report from 2020, Preventing the Next Pandemic, warned., Valeti's leap from cardiology to food innovation was inspired by a belief that there was a better way to bring meat to the table., He recalls working in a campus dining hall in medical school. He was sent to a slaughterhouse where he saw hundreds of chickens hanging on a production line. ""They were literally moving past at blazing speed, they'd be upside down with blood everywhere,"" Valeti recalls. ""That was an image that just stayed in my head."", He became a vegetarian, but he knew many people are resolute carnivores. Despite calls from climate change scientists to eat less meat, the globe is demanding more of it. Americans now eat more than 220 pounds of meat per person, per year, compared to 193 pounds a year in the early 1980s., After his aha moment in the cardiology lab, Valeti became convinced he could develop a viable technique for cultivating meat from animal cells. ""Once I got that idea into my head it was nearly impossible to get out,"" Valeti recalls., Upside Foods CEO Uma Valeti prepares to sample a recently cooked chicken breast. Brian L. Frank for NPR hide caption, Upside Foods CEO Uma Valeti prepares to sample a recently cooked chicken breast., He began raising money and started Upside (formerly called Memphis Meats) in 2015. At the time his two children were young, and his wife, also a doctor, was supportive of the decision despite the risks involved in a start-up., He's won over plenty of investors along the way, including Bill Gates and venture capitalist John Doerr, and the company is now valued at more than a billion dollars. Some of the largest companies involved in traditional meat production, including Tyson and Cargill have also invested., Though the idea of meat grown in tanks elicits an ""ick"" response from many people, the emerging industry sees market potential. According to consumer research, 88% of Gen Z consumers in the U.S. say they'd be somewhat open to trying cultivated meat, compared with about 72% of baby boomers., ""We feel super bullish on the prospects for plant-based meat as well as cultivated meat,"" says Bruce Friedrich of the Good Food Institute which tracks investment trends and lobbies for alternative proteins., Climate-conscious consumers would be likely early adopters, Friedrich says, but for the market to really take off the products need to taste great and be cost-competitive, he says. ""Until they get there, they're going to stay niche,"" Friedrich predicts. ""Price and taste are why people make their food decisions."", When I asked Valeti about price parity with conventional meat he said the goal is to be price-competitive. ""It will take time to build,"" Valeti acknowledged. As for taste, he says his team is ready to wow consumers., Chicken breast is prepared at Upside Foods.Upside Meats is one of the biggest companies in the cultivated meats space, having raised upwards of a $ billion to continue research and development. Brian L. Frank for NPR hide caption, Chicken breast is prepared at Upside Foods.Upside Meats is one of the biggest companies in the cultivated meats space, having raised upwards of a $ billion to continue research and development., During our visit, we stopped in the company's state-of-the-art test kitchen for taste of Upside Foods' chicken. I was asked to sign a waiver before tasting it, because it's not yet legal to sell cell-cultured meat in the U.S., I was served a piece of their chicken, pan-fried in a white-wine butter sauce. My first reaction: ""It's delicious."" (Isn't everything in wine-butter sauce?) And the texture was chewy, closely replicating the texture of chicken breast (minus bones, and tough bits or gristle.) ""It tastes like chicken,"" I said, to which Valeti quickly replied, ""It is chicken!"", It took Valeti and his team years to develop the technology behind these tasty bites. A key challenge was creating the feed for the cells. Cells need a mix of proteins, carbohydrates and fats (just as animals do) but, designing the exact formulation was part alchemy, and a lot of trial and error., The feed needed to maximize growth, but also produce a good taste, texture and nutritional value. He quickly realized no single scientist had the skills to figure this out alone., A muscle biologist can focus on growth, but he brought in nutritional biochemists and engineers to tackle the competing challenges linked to taste and growth. ""We had to develop a multidisciplinary team of scientists,"" Valeti says., The FDA and the USDA are working together on a regulatory framework ""to help move these innovative products along into the U.S. market, as long as we're making sure that everything can be done safely and with appropriate labeling,"" the FDA's Susan Mayne told NPR., Upside Food's pre-market consultation was the first to be completed, and the FDA says it will review each company's submission separately. ""We encourage firms to have these conversations with us often and early in their product development phase,"" an FDA spokesperson wrote in an email., A recent executive order from the Biden administration, which calls for advancing innovative solutions in climate change and food security, including ""cultivating alternative food sources,"" was viewed by many in the nascent cultivated food industry as a sign of increased momentum toward approval. The USDA is currently developing labeling requirements., One of Upside Foods' many competitors, Good Meat will serve its cultivated chicken at the COP-27 climate conference this week, after debuting its product in Singapore. Good Meat, one of the bigger companies in the cultivated meats space. Brian L. Frank for NPR hide caption, One of Upside Foods' many competitors, Good Meat will serve its cultivated chicken at the COP-27 climate conference this week, after debuting its product in Singapore. Good Meat, one of the bigger companies in the cultivated meats space., There are debates about whether cultivated meat is healthy — or potentially healthier than conventional meat. ""It's a very nuanced question without a very simple answer,"" explains Dana Hunnes, a registered dietitian at UCLA Medical Center. Opinions tend to reflect the range of views about meat in general., Hunnes says cultivated meat may not appeal to vegans or vegetarians. She points to the healthfulness of plant-based diets, which is the diet she follows, and says some people don't want to eat meat, no matter how it's produced. Also, the cultivated meat industry has relied on fetal bovine serum from cows as a growth medium for the cells, though Upside Foods has developed an animal component-free alternative., But most Americans are meat-eaters, and dieticians say meat is a good source of protein and important micronutrients including B vitamins. Part of the intrigue of cultivated meat is that it can be altered for improved nutrition. For instance, if cells were fed omega-3 fatty acids during the growing process, then, in theory, these heart-healthy fats could be absorbed into the meat., ""It is possible to create a so-called healthier version of the meat,"" Hunnes says, though much of this has not yet been explored since the industry is so new., Scientists at Good Meat work on cell cultures which will be used for the company's cultivated meats. Brian L. Frank for NPR hide caption, Scientists at Good Meat work on cell cultures which will be used for the company's cultivated meats., From a public health perspective, a potential advantage of cultivated meat is the fact that without live animals to catch and spread disease, no antibiotics are needed in production facilities and there's decreased likelihood of foodborne illness from intestinal pathogens., For instance, salmonella, a bacteria that lives in animal intestines and is shed through their feces, would not be present in a cultivated meat production facility. ""From a food safety standpoint, it probably has a one up,"" on the traditional meat industry, Hunnes says., Because this is a new industry, there are potential unknowns. Some scientists say it's possible that unforeseen biological mechanisms could occur as the meat grows, such as cells multiplying in unpredictable ways. There's a continued need for research as the industry heads toward commercialization., The first cultivated meat products were produced from cells biopsied directly from live animals. But this process isn't efficient. Over the last few years, start-ups have worked to identify ""immortalized"" cell lines, that ""can be grown almost indefinitely without having to go back to the animal,"" explains David Kaplan, professor of biomedical engineering of Tufts University., His lab received a $10 million grant from USDA to help develop the cultured meat industry. ""We need more and more,"" immortalized cell lines, Kaplan says, as the industry looks to expand to different types of meat, poultry and fish., Another unknown is the exact climate impact of cultivated meat. Researchers at the University of Oxford modeled the potential climate change impact of cattle compared to cultivated meat. One advantage of cultivated meat is that it will not produce methane emissions, which is a potent greenhouse gas produced by cattle., But the cultivated meat industry will contribute to CO2 emissions, given that its production facilities will use electricity. The researchers conclude that the relative impact will be determined by whether — or how quickly — the energy used to power the cultivated meat production facilities comes from clean-energy, or decarbonized energy., Upside Foods CEO, Uma Valeti. Brian L. Frank for NPR hide caption, For Valeti, the potential benefits of cultivated meat are too important not to try to overcome the obstacles. He sees a future with a better alternative to the current system of producing meat, and he's determined to create it., Valeti says, ultimately, as a doctor he might have been able to help a few thousand patients during his career. But, by taking the leap to cultivated meat, with its potential promise to overhaul meat production, he believes he can have a larger impact. ""This could literally affect billions of human lives and save potentially trillions of animal lives,"" Valeti says., While awaiting regulatory approval, he's moving forward to bring the product to people's plates. He has signed a partnership with Dominique Crenn, the co-owner and chef of the three-Michelin-starred restaurant Atelier Crenn in San Francisco, who has agreed to provide culinary consulting and recipe development and — once the new product is approved for market — to serve Upside's cultivated chicken at her restaurant.",Shots - Health News

Maansi Srivastava/NPR hide caption, Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore is a founding member of the nonprofit that made a tool to track big polluters., In the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, one of the longstanding challenges has been figuring out who is exactly producing them and how much., Now, a new global tracker is helping to make clear exactly where major greenhouse gas emissions are originating. Created by the nonprofit Climate Trace, the interactive map uses a combination of satellites, sensors and machine learning to measure the top polluters worldwide., It observes how much greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — are being emitted at specific locations, such as power plants and oil refineries. Former Vice President Al Gore, who is a founding member of the initiative, said it is meant to serve as a more reliable and accurate alternative to companies self-reporting their emissions estimates., ""Cheating is impossible with this artificial intelligence method, because they would have to somehow falsify multiple sets of data,"" he told NPR's Michel Martin on All Things Considered., Gore recently returned from Egypt where world leaders have been convening to discuss the climate crisis at the annual U.N. climate conference, also known as COP27., He believes the tracker will help countries stick to their pledges to reach net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050., The emissions tool employs over 300 satellites; sensors on land, planes and ships; as well as artificial intelligence to build models of emission estimates., Right now, it tracks about 72,000 of the highest emitting greenhouse gas sources. That includes every power plant, large ship and large plane in the entire world, Gore said., And that's just the beginning. By next year, Gore hopes to be tracking millions of major emitting sites., ""We will have essentially all of them,"" he said., Gore said 75% of the world's greenhouse emissions come from countries that have made pledges to become carbon-neutral by 2050. ""Now that they know exactly where it's coming from, they have tools that will enable them to reduce their emissions,"" he told NPR., He added that the database, which is free and accessible online, can help inform countries about how much pollution is being emitted by the companies they are working with or considering working with., It is not enough for companies to self-report, he said. For instance, Climate Trace found that the oil and gas industry has been significantly underreporting its emissions., ""We found their emissions are three times higher than they have been telling the United Nations,"" Gore said., In the U.S. specifically, oil and gas producers have underreported how much methane they've been releasing, recent research suggests., That doesn't mean companies were intentionally cheating, Gore added. However, he said underreporting prevents governments and the public from staying on track with their net-zero pledge., Six regional governments in Mexico, Europe and Africa have already entered into working agreements for using the tool, Gore said., The world is generally off track from its goal of cutting emissions that drive climate change, but Gore said he's been impressed by recent efforts around the globe to address the issue., In the U.S., Gore pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes over $360 billion to tackle climate change and incentivizes consumers to make greener choices. Gore described the law as ""the biggest climate legislation in the history of the world."", He also praised Australia for voting in a new government that pledged to shift away from coal and Brazil for electing a new president who vowed to stop destroying the Amazon., ""So there's great danger, but there is hope,"" Gore said.

Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was invited shortly after he won Brazil's presidential election last month. Lula helped roll back destruction of the Amazon rainforest during his previous stint as Brazil's president. So his return to the world stage is being hailed by environmentalists. Lula will have his work cut out for him when he takes office in January. Deforestation in Brazil reached a 15-year high under outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro. John Otis is in the Brazilian city of Manaus on the banks of the Amazon River. Good morning, John. Good morning, Ayesha. John, so how does Lula plan to protect the Amazon rainforest? Well, in his first speech as president-elect last month, Lula promised to aim for zero deforestation over the next four years. And one of the ways that he wants to do that is to beef up law enforcement and government agencies that protect the environment. And this is key because these agencies were just totally gutted under Bolsonaro, the outgoing president. Bolsonaro also allowed for a kind of free-for-all of mining, ranching and farming in the jungle. And all of this led to this huge spike in deforestation. So to turn things around, Lula is likely to announce several other measures at the climate summit this week. For example, he's expected to name an environmental czar for Brazil. And that's sort of like the post John Kerry holds in the Biden administration. And Lula may also announce a strategic alliance with Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. And the idea there is that by negotiating together, these three countries may be able to secure larger donations and carbon credits from the Global North in exchange for preserving their jungles. So Lula's environmental record is undeniably better than Bolsonaro's, but he's not beyond criticism, right? That's correct. Lula - he first served as president of Brazil between 2003 and 2010, and during that period, the rate of deforestation did drop dramatically. However, the Amazon is home to more than 30 million Brazilians, and they have to be able to make a living. And so Lula - when he was president, he was making a lot of concessions to farmers and ranchers and promoting commercial activities in the Amazon. His administration also approved the Belo Monte Dam. Now, that's one of the largest hydroelectric dams in the world, and it's wreaked havoc on some parts of the jungle. He's rejected calls to transition away from fossil fuels. So Lula's a leftist, but he's by no stretch of the imagination an environmental radical. Expectations on this one leader are certainly high. Like, can Lula deliver? Yeah, he's got a lot of challenges here. I mean, I was just recently out on a jungle highway here in the Amazon. And in some places it was really hard to breathe because there was so much smoke from farmers and ranchers who were burning down the forest. So it really is going to be tough. And the other problem here is that even as the climate crisis gets worse, Brazil politically is growing a lot more conservative. Lots of people in the Amazon voted for Bolsonaro. And so there's going to be a lot of resistance to any kind of Brazilian Green New Deal. On the other hand, the international community - as we mentioned, they're going to be pulling for Lula. Norway has already said it's going to resume making payments to Brazil in exchange for protecting the jungle. That's a deal that was suspended under the Bolsonaro government. And to further bolster this kind of cooperation, Lula has also suggested that the next U.N. climate conference could be held in Brazil. That was John Otis speaking to us from the Amazon city of Manaus. Thank you so much, John. Thank you. ",Climate

Snow and glaciers are melting around the high altitude Himalayan town, and the melting coupled with more variable rainfall means river flooding is an ever-growing threat. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, Presidents and prime ministers, secretaries and kings are in Egypt for the United Nations annual climate change negotiations. And when world leaders talk about climate change, they evoke one group more than any other: children., The plight of future generations, and the need to protect today's children from a future made unlivable by global warming, is at the moral heart of international climate negotiations. The United Nations estimates about a billion children are at extremely high risk because of climate change, whether that's because of rising seas, heavy rain, drought or deadly heat waves., Students at the Rolwaling Sangag Choling Monastery School in Beding take a break to play volleyball in the afternoon sun. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, But what is life like for children living on the front lines of climate change? How is information about a changing planet passed down to the inheritors of a hotter Earth? And in places where the Internet is not ubiquitous, how do young people understand the changes that they are witnessing?, We visited one school in Nepal's Rolwaling Valley and talked to students and teachers there about their experiences, frustrations and hopes for the future., Many of the peaks near Beding have less snow and more bare rock than they used to because of global warming. They are a constant reminder of the changing climate for students and teachers at the town's monastery school. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, A school surrounded by beauty and danger, The Rolwaling Sangag Choling Monastery School is nestled in a steep valley. At the bottom is the Rolwaling River. Behind the school, the rocky cliffs of the Himalayan mountains climb dramatically to peaks of more than 23,000 feet. It is about a two day walk from the school to the nearest road. The area only had sporadic solar electricity until earlier this year., The school is home to nearly two dozen boys who live and study there most of the year, except for a brief period in the winter when they return to their hometowns nearby., The Rolwaling Sangag Choling Monastery School is home to 21 students, including Mingma Thamang (bottom right.) The school is located at about 13,000 feet above sea level. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, It is a life that is intensely, unavoidably, connected to nature. And the students, especially the older ones, have noticed nature changing., ""We can see many mountains here,"" says Mingma Thamang, an 18-year-old student at the school who has hiked up to a nearby glacial lake multiple times in recent years. He says he has heard rumors that the lake, which is upstream from his school, could cause a big flood in the future., 18-year-old Migma Thamang is nearly ready to graduate from the school. He says he hopes to pursue further religious education and someday become a lama – a Buddhist religious leader. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, Indeed, the lake is at critical risk for flooding, according to scientists. And the school is located very close to the river, and would likely be damaged or destroyed in such a disaster., Bolendra Acharya has taught at the school for 12 years and says there are other obvious changes as well. Snow that used to cover the nearby mountains in thick blankets is now spotty and thin. Now, bare rock shows even on the highest peaks. And rain that used to arrive on a reliable schedule in the summer is now more variable., Bolendra Acharya has taught at the school for 12 years. He grew up in a neighboring valley and says he has witnessed profound changes in the area's climate. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, The unreliable rain is a problem because most people who live in the area farm, raise livestock or work in the mountain trekking industry. When the rain comes late, or all at once, it hurts crops and makes it difficult to safely cross the river. Domestic yaks and other livestock are unable to access grazing areas., Nima Sherpa, 91, is the oldest person living in Beding, Nepal. When she was a child, she says a large lake nearby didn't even exist. But as glaciers melt in the mountains, the lake has swelled and transformed life here by threatening the town with flooding. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, And as the area gets more popular with local Nepalese tourists, it also becomes more dangerous for hikers who are using narrow riverside paths and suspension bridges because of high water from heavy rain and glacial melt., Acharya grew up nearby and says, when he was young, life in the valley was very different.

""From my point of view, I'm very interested to introduce the students to climate change,"" he says, ""because they live in an area where there is a lot to learn."", Right now, there's no formal climate change curriculum, although they do study general science. The primary goal of the school is to educate students to become lamas – Buddhist religious leaders. Students study math, history, science and other academic subjects for the first five years and those that continue on for the remaining three years focus on religious and language training., ""We learned about the weather, about different types of animals,"" says Thamang., Lhakpa Sonam Sherpa, who recently graduated from the school, says he learned about plants and animals of the region, and about the larger geography of Nepal., Many young people in the area are unaware of the how they fit into the larger picture of global climate change, despite their personal experiences with changing weather patterns. Lhakpa Sonam Sherpa recently graduated from the monastery school and says he'd like to know more about global warming. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, But students at the school say they know only a little about where their home fits in the larger picture of global climate change, and would like to know more., ""We want to learn more about the environment,"" says Thamang. ""Because then maybe we can do something to make it cleaner and safer."", The teacher, Acharya, says even if most of his students will go on to work in religious roles that don't directly interact with environmental policy, it's still important to bring climate change into the classroom. These future religious leaders will be the ones that local people turn to as they try to make sense of their changing environment. And decisions to protect local forests or adapt to flood risk will likely include consultations with religious authorities in this heavily Buddhist area., To that end, Acharya says he wants his students to understand that the changes they are witnessing are being caused by people in other parts of the world., ""We are not the people polluting the environment. It's factories in cities, especially out in the bigger world. It's not people like us, living in rural areas, that are contributing to the damage of Earth,"" he says. ""Local students need knowledge about climate change, to be empowered to make their own decisions, and to protect themselves.""",Climate

Mint/Sneha Srivastava/Mint via Getty Images hide caption, Family members of farmer Dattu Narayan Shewal, who committed suicide after a hailstorm hit his village in Marathwada, India, in 2014. Farmers there were planting single cash crops, so a climate-related disaster would wipe out their livelihoods and leave them unable to buy food. Swayam Shikshan Prayog would seek out their families, particularly the women, and help them get back on their feet., On Sept. 30, 1993, at 3:56 a.m., a deadly earthquake shook Latur and Osmanabad, districts in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. It killed 10,000 people and demolished 52 villages., While many nongovernmental organizations were involved in the immediate rescue and relief work, there was one group that worked a little differently. It focused on efforts that engaged with women from affected communities and aimed to ensure their long-term wellbeing. The Swayam Shikshan Prayog (SSP), established four years later, began its journey by going door-to-door after the earthquake, meeting thousands of women. The group trained the women to become farmers and entrepreneurs, enabling them to become financially independent and rise above the adversity and loss they'd encountered., Today, Swayam Shikshan Prayog is one of four winners of the Local Adaptation Champions Awards, organized by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA), that is being announced at the COP27 climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt., The awards recognize community-led efforts to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. Winners will receive €15,000 to help their further their work. In an interview with NPR, SSP Director Upmanyu Patil shares significant moments from his journey., This interview has been edited for length and clarity., You've helped around 300,000 rural women from across India adapt to climate change. How did your journey begin?, It began with our relief efforts during the Latur earthquake., Swayam Shikshan Prayog Director Upmanyu Patil says he would like to use the prize money to expand the organization to reach more women. Swayam Shikshan Prayog hide caption, Prema Gopalan was the founder of SSP, but unfortunately we lost her last March. I've been working with Prema and the team since 1993. I took over operations after she passed away. In those early days, we worked largely with disasters — the Gujarat Earthquake [2001], the Tamil Nadu tsunami [2004], floods in Bihar [2007] and in Kerala [2018]. We're working more extensively in three Indian states now — Kerala, Bihar and Maharashtra., What do you focus on during the aftermath of a climate disaster?, Our focus is on restoration of livelihoods, especially for women. While relief efforts are needed in the immediate aftermath, long-term rehabilitation is our goal. We support them financially, so they can revive any business ventures that were lost as a result of these disasters. In some cases, we provide training so they can gain more skills that will help them set up entrepreneurial ventures. We are actively engaged with communities 3 to 4 years after a disaster, and even post that we continue to work with communities, helping local women generate more income., Why did you start working on climate-resilient agriculture initiatives?, There were many farmer suicides in Marathwada [in the western Indian state of Maharashtra] when we worked there in 2012-15. When we surveyed the area, we realized that farmers there were planting only a single cash crop like sugar cane or cotton [crops produced only for their commercial value]. This was a problem, because if there was a climate-related disaster and the crop failed, they could not sell it and neither would they have money to buy food. We realized that there were mounting losses in the process, and that was causing great distress [to farmers]. What they needed most was food security. Being an organization with a mission to empower women to take on decision-making roles in their families and communities, we knew that this could come only with economic empowerment, because a breadwinner is a decision-maker. So we began to speak with these families, suggesting that they allocate a piece of their land — say about one-fourth or a fifth — for women to cultivate food crops. We provided training in organic farming, helping them sow pulses, grains, vegetables, fruits., Did farmers always cultivate a single cash crop in this area?, No, they didn't. If you go back 25 years ago, people sowed multiple crops, ensuring food for their families and communities. Things changed when farming became commercialized, driven by market forces instead of primary needs. India's green revolution of the 1960's, which ushered in pesticides and fertilizers for greater yields, did a lot of damage too. We're trying to get communities to go back to traditional practices. We are mining the knowledge of elderly people in these communities, checking with agricultural departments at local universities to see if these traditional practices are backed by science and if they can come back. For instance, practices such as sowing seeds from native plants around your own home, creating your own compost from agricultural waste, and creating bio-fertilizer by using leaves., Was it hard to make that transition to food crops and convince families to give away that land?, Initially it was, but we tell them that it's for their own food security. They can do whatever they want with the rest of the land. We ask them to involve women in growing their food. We've faced challenges in two areas. Many don't believe that organic farming can give you the same yields as farming with the use of chemical fertilizers. And many men don't think women can farm efficiently, even though women do a lot of manual labor on farms. They don't believe that she can take charge of the sowing or be a decision-maker., How did you go about changing mindsets?, It takes time, but we reason with them. We show them how organic farming costs far less, when compared to the high costs of chemical fertilizers. And with 2 to 3 years of training, we prove that women can build their capabilities and take lead in their agricultural sector, just as they have done in sanitation and health. Getting [communities] to believe in this is a challenge in the initial phase., Once women grow food for their families, what's the next step?, Once they secure food for their families and they have excess, the next challenge is finding a place to sell their extra produce. We link them to markets, and try to secure better prices for them. It's a challenge too, because traditional marketing methods require packaging, certification [and] branding or you won't get premium prices. The women work hard to produce organic food crops, but because of this, they often can't sell at the prices that justify that effort. They are unhappy about that., Is there anything you do to ensure that they get fair prices?, We have started women farmer producer companies [where women farmers are partners, a system with collective ownership and joint investment]. They are involved in cultivating grains and pulses, but also in selling dairy [and] poultry. These allied activities ensure their incomes., How does climate change affect their daily lives and their farming?, There are a lot of weather-related changes that we're seeing in recent years. For instance, earlier, the rains would come in mid-June, and remain till mid-October. People do their sowing and harvesting at this time. By February, it's time to sow the summer crop. But now, the rains come only in mid-July, and these are torrential, heavy rains. Then they stop abruptly, and farmers lose their crops. Farming is their only source of income and it is threatened by climate change. It's very distressing and women are especially vulnerable. Climate change has an impact on everything — health, economic conditions, water sources and food security., You encourage ""clean energy initiatives"" in local communities. What does that involve?, In 2005, British Petroleum wanted to understand the energy needs in rural markets. So we partnered with them in that research. We found that cooking energy is a primary need in rural households. Together, we created a product — a ""clean"" cooking stove run on biomass pellets., In 2012, we got funding from USAID to help create 1,000 women entrepreneurs, setting them up financially to be able to sell these stoves and other clean energy products [like solar panels] and services to 200,000 families in their communities., How do these stoves that run on biomass work?, It works with cow dung. Every family has 3 to 4 cattle. They collect the cow dung every day. They feed this into a ""bio-digester"" — it's a machine that converts cow dung into cooking gas and slurry. The process takes 6 to 8 hours. We use the slurry as organic fertilizer. And the biogas is piped to power the stove. This is safer than burning cow dung directly, which is a practice in many rural homes. It's also safer than LPG–compressed liquified petroleum gas, which is usually piped in for cooking. Each farmer owns their own biomass machine., How do you intend to use the prize money from the award?, We would like to expand our scope and see if we can get more women involved., What are the biggest changes you've seen after all these years of working with rural communities?, One of the biggest changes is in the attitudes of men. Earlier, men didn't like it when we met with women exclusively and they were not involved. They were wary and suspicious. But now, they actually welcome us, because they've seen how our helping women helps their children in turn, and improves the families' quality of life. There's more appreciation now replacing the snarky comments that we got earlier! This is a major change we've seen over the last 30 years., It just goes to show that by empowering women, we can empower everyone., Kamala Thiagarajan is a freelance journalist based in Madurai, Southern India.

David Boraks/WFAE hide caption, Signs like this one, spotted Oct. 26, 2022, are all over northern Gaston County, N.C., near where Piedmont Lithium wants to build a 1,500-acre lithium mining and processing operation., CHARLOTTE, N.C. - As world leaders meet for another climate summit in Egypt, the U.S. is pushing to mine more lithium for electric vehicle batteries at home. EVs will help cut pollution from transportation, the nation's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. But there's a tradeoff, as residents have learned near Charlotte, where a big open-pit mine is proposed., A company called Piedmont Lithium wants to build a mine and processing operation on 1,500 acres in northern Gaston County, about 30 miles west of Charlotte., Emily Winter, a community relations coordinator and geologist for Piedmont, leads the way to a large rock outcrop near what someday might be the mine's South Pit., ""So within this rock, it contains spodumene, the mineral. And that mineral spodumene contains lithium that we can convert to lithium hydroxide that then goes into batteries,"" Winter explains., Emily Winter of Piedmont Lithium on Oct. 26, 2022 points out lithium-bearing spodumene in a rock outcrop off Whitesides Road in Bessemer City, N.C. David Boraks/WFAE hide caption, Emily Winter of Piedmont Lithium on Oct. 26, 2022 points out lithium-bearing spodumene in a rock outcrop off Whitesides Road in Bessemer City, N.C., Lithium deposits run through the county in a mile-wide north-south band, known as the Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt. For decades in the 20th century, mines here supplied most of the world's lithium, until cheaper sources were found in South America and Australia. Now the element is in high demand for electric vehicle batteries, and investors see an opportunity., ""There is very little production of lithium raw materials, or any battery raw materials, in the US. The potential's there, but it'll take time to bring it online,"" says Piedmont Lithium CEO Keith Phillips., When Piedmont Lithium dedicated its new headquarters in the nearby town of Belmont this summer, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis was there. The North Carolina Republican said the U.S. needs its own sources of lithium and lithium processing to counter China., ""The Chinese have a stated strategy of being the world's economic and military superpower by 2050. And they don't intend to do that through a great war. They intend to do it by putting their tentacles around the globe, economically,"" Tillis said. ""They intend to make sure that the western world is dependent upon them for lithium, for tantalum, for rare earth minerals, so that they can literally beat us by never firing a shot."", Tillis said that's why he supports Piedmont Lithium's efforts to open a new mine - as long as it's done in an environmentally responsible way. But that's the catch., When climate goals lead to environmental problems, Piedmont's plans call for four open-pit mines 500 feet deep. That means demolishing houses, digging up farm fields and woods, and disrupting streams. Some neighbors have sold their land to the company. But others whose property borders the site aren't happy., Locke Bell owns 120 acres backing up to the planned South Pit. ""Relative to the proposed mine, I have 4,160 feet of common boundary,"" he says., Bell is a former district attorney and has been following Piedmont's plans since 2017, when the company approached him about mining on his land. He declined the offer after seeing a detailed map of the proposed mine., ""Suddenly, I saw these massive mines - open pits... We have enough of that around here that's toxic already,'"" he says., He's talking about old lithium mines nearby that closed in the 1980s and 1990s and are now contaminated with arsenic, which occurs naturally in the area's soil and rocks., Warren Snowden walks on his family farm in Gaston County, N.C., with his dog Finn on Oct. 29, 2022. The property borders the site of a 1,500-acre lithium mine planned by Piedmont Lithium. He is helping to lead an opposition group called Stop Piedmont Lithium.

The property borders the site of a 1,500-acre lithium mine planned by Piedmont Lithium. He is helping to lead an opposition group called Stop Piedmont Lithium., A few miles away on the other side of the mine site, Warren Snowdon has similar concerns. His family's old farm is just across a stream, about 600 yards, from the planned East Pit. He's helping to lead an opposition group called Stop Piedmont Lithium., ""Our issue is on every front: It's water. It's air. It's light pollution. It's noise. It's traffic. Get us a solar farm. Get us a wind farm,"" says Snowdon, who is quick to say he's not opposed to the country's transition to renewable energy., State and local officials still must approve the mine, Piedmont Lithium still needs key approvals, including state air and mining permits. Both are delayed while the company responds to requests for more information from North Carolina agencies. Piedmont also faces local political opposition., Chad Brown chairs the Gaston County Commission, which will have to approve a rezoning for the mine., ""With the information I have right now, I probably would not call for a vote on this,"" Brown says. ""I would have to have tons of more information just for the environmental side, and as far as air quality, water quality, different things like that."", Last year, the commission adopted a 60-day moratorium so it could update its zoning rules to allow a mine. The ordinance has some teeth - it limits blasting and truck traffic, Brown says. But he's not sure Piedmont will be able to get the electricity and water it needs for mining and processing., Asked if he thinks the mining project will happen, he says, ""I think right now, you're still at 50-50, just for the simple fact of it's a long way out."", Still, Piedmont Lithium's CEO Keith Phillips is optimistic., ""So the permitting process is more involved, and it will take longer. And our plan, our hope, is that we'll be in production in Carolina in 2026, and will be fully permitted and approved and funded sometime in 2024,"" he says., While it pursues that goal, the company has a backup plan: It's building a processing plant in Tennessee with help from a $141.7 million federal grant. And it's counting on mines in Quebec and Ghana to supply lithium ore., Piedmont's North Carolina neighbors are rooting for that backup plan instead of the open-pit lithium mine in their community.",Climate

Arden S. Barnes/The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption, At the Appalachian School of Luthiery in Hindman, Ky., days after July's catastrophic floods, luthier Kris Patrick searches through the mud-caked remains of instruments and materials., It was weeks before Doug Naselroad could bring himself to set foot inside the Museum of the Mountain Dulcimer in Hindman, Ky. He knew the space all too well, having co-curated its exhibits, and had felt heartsick every time he tried to wrap his mind around what it would look like empty. When he finally did get up the nerve to visit, he says, the sight of the place gave him a ghostly chill — ""like you're Indiana Jones exploring his own tomb. You have trepidation and dread looking in at the things you cherish and trying to will them back."", In the early hours of July 28, after days of heavy rain, floodwaters from nearby Troublesome Creek rushed through the museum with enough force to blow a door off its hinges and shatter the front windows. The water carried away dozens of historic instruments, including early examples of the hourglass-shaped dulcimer, developed and honed in Knott and Letcher counties in southeast Kentucky, and one once played by Appalachian music legend Jean Ritchie. About two-thirds of the collection ""just disappeared."" What was recovered will need extensive restoration., ""Now we're in just a big salvage operation,"" Naselroad says. Sounding philosophical, he adds, ""Is this a hopeless project? You tell me."", Eastern Kentuckians are familiar with flooding; the region's creeks and mountain runoff have wreaked havoc on these communities for decades, centuries. But there's a distressing redundancy in the responses I heard when asking people about this particular weather event, which swept through Central Appalachia but did the most concentrated damage here, in the southeast part of the state., ""This was like an unthinkable that happened,"" says John Haywood, a tattoo artist and musician who lives in Letcher County and specializes in the ""old-time, drop-thumb, overhand east Kentucky"" style of banjo. ""I've never even seen the water get above a certain level, let alone like five, six feet above that level,"" he says. ""I think that's one of the reasons why it was so devastating, because it was just so huge."", Damaged instruments from the Museum of the Mountain Dulcimer line the upper floor of Hindman's Appalachian Artisan Center. Stephanie Wolf/WFPL hide caption, By the time this summer's historic floods subsided, tens of thousands of eastern Kentucky households had lost power. Thirteen counties had received major disaster declarations from the federal government. Twenty-one public water systems were operating at reduced capacity and two more were fully disabled. A report from Gov. Andy Beshear's office has put the official death toll at 43. Driving along Kentucky Route 15 in early August, I saw school buses shoved into buildings and entire homes forced off their foundations., Three months later, the floods have receded from national headlines as new weather emergencies have hit Florida, South Carolina, Puerto Rico and elsewhere. But the absence of news cameras doesn't mean a catastrophe is over. There are still hundreds in temporary housing in state parks and travel trailers, who don't yet know when their lives will return to normal. And for the people, places and institutions that make up the region's storied music scene, a more complicated question looms: What does it actually mean, after a disaster like this, to rebuild an artistic community?, The practical steps toward recovery, though daunting, are already in motion throughout the region — repairing facilities and venues, restoring instruments, wrangling the logistics and raising the funds to gradually get programs and performances back on the calendar. But the music-minded residents I encountered while traveling through these counties often spoke of a higher responsibility, inherent to their roles as artists, educators, craftspeople or simply listeners. To play and share music in Appalachian Kentucky, the wisdom went, is to be a steward of its traditions — and that duty is never more serious than in times like these, when the tangible is lost., Sarah Kate Morgan, a director at Hindman Settlement School in Knott County, with her mountain dulcimer. After the floods, Morgan's role shifted from education to coordinating relief operations. Stephanie Wolf/WFPL hide caption, I met Sarah Kate Morgan at Hindman Settlement School in Knott County, where she serves as director of traditional arts education. The school is 120 years old, established to educate the children of coal mining families. Immediately after the floods, Morgan's role shifted from teaching kids about Appalachian music and dance to coordinating relief operations: helping house displaced people in the undamaged parts of the campus and providing transportation for those trying to apply for federal aid., ""For the next year, we're going to be focused on rebuilding what we lost instead of reaching out, like we usually do,"" Morgan explains. ""We won't be able to do as much of the good work that we used to ... and I fear that we'll lose some momentum."", While the humanitarian need was the priority when we spoke, she's also begun thinking about the region's cultural recovery. Her staff and volunteers have been trying to salvage every bit they can of the school's precious archives, which contain journals, photos, documents, quilts and historic records curated and cared for by generations of Appalachians. The collection, which predates the school itself, was submerged in several feet of water., As we were wrapping up our interview, Morgan fetched her own mountain dulcimer from her on-site apartment, saying, ""It'd be nice to play music for a second."" Her brief set included a subdued rendition of Ernie Carpenter's ""Elk River Blues"" and Ola Belle Reed's ""I've Endured."" When I thanked her for the performance, she answered as though I'd done her a favor: ""It was good for me to share."" Music, she confided, had been a scarce presence in her life lately., Appalachia is a place where you've always had to make your own fun. We wouldn't want to live here without music., Doug Naselroad, luthier, Half an hour away in the hard-hit town of Whitesburg, water soaked another extensive archive housed at the arts and media center Appalshop. It included artifacts made by local artisans, documentary films and master tape recordings of musicians who helped shape the region's cultural landscape., ""It does really hurt to think about what is going to end up being lost,"" says Carrie Wells Carter, a musician I met in Whitesburg. ""It makes you just want to cling to and hold onto every single piece of recorded music that you can get your hands on, everything written about everybody that's ever lived here and been in this place and shared their music or art."", A spokesperson for Appalshop said they were able to get all of their materials into ""stabilizing environments"" (the nonprofit had put out an urgent call for freezer trucks immediately after the floods), but it remains unclear how much can be salvaged. The center's film department, radio station and youth education center, the Appalachian Media Institute, lost all of their equipment and many instruments., Both Appalshop and Hindman Settlement School have digitized portions of their collections. But to Haywood — who, in addition to his music and tattooing pursuits, considers himself an archivist of his own family's old photos and relics — knowing that the information an object carried is preserved doesn't diminish the heartbreak of losing the cherished original., ""There really is something special about being able to go through the actual photos and the actual items because those are like your firsthand accounts,"" he says. ""People can digitize stuff, but often, through that, they miss certain things"" — such as the smell and tactile qualities of an instrument, or the feeling of an original photograph in your hand., With all of these physical pieces of eastern Kentucky's music community endangered — performance venues, centers of learning, rare documents and instruments — I asked Haywood what it would mean to him to rebuild. ""It's an interesting question,"" he replied. ""Because there's the fear in everyone's mind: This is going to happen again."", Photographs soaked by the flooding at Hindman Settlement School dry on clotheslines. Stephanie Wolf/WFPL hide caption, Flooding is becoming more severe and more frequent in eastern Kentucky, a trend that has been linked to climate change and the region's history of strip mining and mountaintop removal mining.

The task of rebuilding a livelihood is daunting enough in itself — but the fear of losing it all again has had him weighing whether he and his family may need to relocate., ""There's a lot of uncertainty,"" he says. ""I think everyone's kind of feeling it out."", Wells Carter and her husband, Matthew Carter, also a musician, asked themselves the same question, especially as flash-flood warnings persisted in the area well after the initial disaster. But Wells Carter says she feels a deep connection to this land that may be irreplaceable. Her family's roots in the area date back to the 1700s, and include a lineage of fiddle players whose legacy she feels proud to continue, playing fiddle and electric bass in her own local bands., ""It's just part of my soul,"" she says. ""You either get it or you don't."", Banjo player, guitarist and vocalist Kevin Howard, who is the event coordinator at Appalshop, says his ideal vision for rebuilding is one where cultural institutions can come back fortified against future weather-related disasters. ""I hate to use the phrase, because it's become a little cliché,"" he admits, ""but hopefully it's an opportunity to build back better."", Howard says that he, too, has no intention of leaving eastern Kentucky. But beyond his own lifestyle, his concern is for the health and preservation of local musical communities that are little-known outside of the region., ""There's more here than what you think is here,"" he says, emphasizing that the area has fostered robust punk, metal and hip-hop scenes in addition to its contributions to country and Americana. ""If you really want to help us, you can buy our music, you can come to our shows or donate to organizations that are helping musicians."", Dwight Yoakam, Chris Stapleton, Ricky Skaggs and Patty Loveless perform in October at Kentucky Rising, a benefit concert for those affected by the 2022 floods. Andy Barron hide caption, On Oct. 11, roughly 14,000 people packed into Rupp Arena in Lexington for Kentucky Rising — a benefit concert organized by the Lexington-born, east Kentucky-raised Chris Stapleton, who had shown up to help with relief work in person in the days following the floods. Tyler Childers and Dwight Yoakam co-headlined with him; Ricky Skaggs, Patty Loveless and S.G. Goodman, all nationally successful artists with deep roots in the state, made guest appearances., ""You did a good thing tonight,"" Stapleton told the arena crowd during the event, which also streamed for paying viewers online and brought in a total of more than $2.9 million, according to partner organization Blue Grass Community Foundation. ""Thank you all for being with us tonight, coming out for a good cause, helping folks out who need some help. That's what we do here in Kentucky."", When I first met Doug Naselroad in August to talk about the damage to the dulcimer museum, his outlook was less optimistic. We were standing among piles of warped wood at one of his own businesses in Hindman, the Appalachian School of Luthiery, which the July floods had turned into a ""mudhole,"" destroying instruments, materials, sound equipment and large collections of work drawings and blueprints. The same befell his nearby Troublesome Creek Stringed Instrument Company, a local builder of guitars, dulcimers and mandolins., ""This whole town is gutted,"" he told me. ""Everything I've built here in the past 10 years has been destroyed."", When we reconnected on the phone many weeks later, his tone had softened. The destruction on the ground was as real as ever, but he was reminded of something left intact in the wreckage of those buildings, a prize the flood couldn't touch., ""Appalachia is a place where you've always had to make your own fun,"" Naselroad says. ""And because so many people are individualistic here, music is a very personal thing. We wouldn't want to live here without music."" Whether steeped in tradition or finding voice in more contemporary styles, he says, the music made in Appalachian Kentucky has long been a celebration of survival. ""That's where an awful lot of our joy occurs, is in music."", Doug Naselroad examines damaged equipment at his Appalchian School of Luthiery. Stephanie Wolf/WFPL hide caption, To him, that joy has been a powerful incentive to rebuild — even when it feels hopeless. Naselroad and his team have begun the long process to restore both the luthiery and the factory, and he hopes to be building instruments again in an alternate facility before the end of the year. As for the museum and its recovered instruments, he says, their story just got bigger: not merely artifacts of the builders and musicians who brought them to life, but now, witnesses to a historic crisis, and participants in the collective recovery., ""The things that can be restored, that can be repaired, that survived? I think it's a powerful statement,"" he says. ""Our heritage can't be destroyed."", John Haywood told me he agrees — but adds that preservation can happen even when those physical objects are beyond saving., ""We can lose all of our instruments, but the instrument isn't really where the music was even kept,"" he says. ""I realized early on that the music is kept by the people."", Stephanie Wolf is an arts and culture reporter at NPR member station WFPL in Louisville, Ky.","NA"

Climate Summit, Friday, Nov. 11, 2022, at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Alex Brandon/AP hide caption, International climate negotiations are nearing their halfway point in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt., Today President Joe Biden made a speech and the United States announced a new proposal to clamp down on pollution from oil and gas operations. And there were some notable absences from the summit as well., Here's what you need to know., President Biden arrived in Egypt today, made a speech and then left for G20 talks in Bali, where he will meet face-to-face with Chinese President Xi Jinping., In his speech, Biden said the United States is following through on promises to cut its greenhouse gas emissions., ""We're proving that good climate policy is good economic policy,"" President Biden told a room of representatives of governments around the world. ""The United States of America will meet our emissions targets by 2030."", The U.S. has pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions between 50 and 52% by 2030. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes electric cars and more efficient buildings, was a major step toward hitting that goal. Still, more will need to be done. Currently, U.S. emissions are expected to fall roughly 39% by 2030., This year, U.S. emissions are projected to rise slightly., Read more about the President's speech here., China emits more greenhouse gas pollution than any other country. The United States is in second place. Meanwhile, India's emissions are rising quickly, and the country is now virtually tied with the European Union as the third largest emitter, according to a report released today by the Global Carbon Project., But the presidents of China and India are skipping this year's climate talks. That makes it unlikely that either country will announce any major plans to cut emissions beyond their current promises., Representatives from China reiterated the country's goals at the talks today: emissions will rise until 2030, then start falling until reaching net-zero in 2060. It's been rated ""highly insufficient"" by the Climate Action Tracker, a site that weighs how countries should be cutting emissions relative to their overall toll on the climate., The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants to tighten regulations for emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas., The agency says its proposal for reducing pollution from oil and gas wells would encourage the use of innovative technology to detect methane emissions. It estimates the proposed rule would reduce methane emissions from covered sources by 87% below 2005 levels by 2030., ""Oil and natural gas operations are the nation's largest industrial source of methane,"" the EPA said in a statement. ""Sharp cuts in methane emissions are among the most critical actions the U.S. can take in the short term to slow the rate of climate change."", The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called on the EPA to ""move full speed ahead"" to finalize the proposed regulation., ""This proposed rule is a positive step forward,"" said Harold Wimmer, CEO of the American Lung Association. Oil and gas companies should have to take the ""strongest steps possible"" to prevent methane leaks and to stop routine flaring — or burning — of the gas, Wimmer said, adding that people who live near oil and gas wells face ""disproportionate health risks."", The American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, said it will push for a final rule that is ""cost-effective, promotes innovation, and creates the regulatory certainty needed for long-term planning."", The White House also announced an initiative with the European Union, the UK, Japan, Canada and Norway to minimize flaring, methane and carbon dioxide emissions from the fossil fuel industry ""to the fullest extent practicable."", And the U.N. said it launched the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS), which will detect and report when major emissions happen., ""We are seeing methane emissions increase at an accelerated rate,"" said Kelly Levin of the Bezos Earth Fund, which helped fund the MARS system. ""With this initiative, armed with greater data and transparency, companies and governments can make greater strides to reduce methane emissions and civil society can keep them accountable to their promises."", The underlying tension behind the COP27 summit is a simple one: emissions are still rising too fast and countries have not pledged to do enough. A new report from the Global Carbon Project highlighted that today. It says emissions from burning fossil fuels are expected to reach record levels this year, more than 50% higher than they were when the Industrial Revolution began., If emissions continue at the current pace, the world risks overshooting its goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees in just nine years., ""We're dangerously close to 1.5 Celsius thresholds,"" says Rob Jackson, climate scientist at Stanford University who worked on the report, which was compiled by scientists around the globe., The pandemic is still having ripple effects on global emissions. In 2020, emissions dropped about 5% as flights were grounded and factories closed down but they came roaring back the following year. Still, emissions in China are expected to decline by about 1% this year, since the country has still implemented Covid measures and development hasn't fully rebounded., In the years to come, China's emissions could rise again. Combined with other countries, that would mean the world still hasn't turned the corner on finally getting emissions to drop.",Climate

Hurricane Nicole hit the state near Vero Beach early this morning with 75-mile-per-hour winds. After coming ashore, it was downgraded to a tropical storm. NPR's Greg Allen reports that since records have been kept, this is the latest in the season a hurricane has ever made landfall on Florida's Atlantic coast. Nicole hit as a Category 1 storm. As hurricanes go, that's on the low end of the scale. Authorities ordered evacuations for people living on barrier islands along much of Florida's Atlantic coast because of the threat of storm surge. As Nicole passed through Florida today, local authorities and Governor Ron DeSantis agreed, it could have been a lot worse. You do have downed trees. You have power lines. You have some road washouts, combine winds and storm surge. We've seen beach erosion, especially in areas that had already seen erosion from Hurricane Ian. From Fort Lauderdale to Daytona Beach, the heavy surf and storm surge damaged piers, washed away dunes and threatened homes and other structures. In Volusia County, authorities evacuated 19 condominium buildings and hotels, also 40 single-family homes. As the beach washed away, at least one home collapsed, and others were in danger of doing so. Volusia County manager, George Recktenwald, said residents won't be able to return until the structures were inspected and declared safe. The structural damage along our coastline is unprecedented. We've never experienced anything like this before. Until Nicole developed in the Atlantic this week, many in Florida thought hurricane season was over. The season doesn't officially end until November 30, but Florida rarely sees landfalling hurricanes this late in the year, especially on its Atlantic coast. The last one was in 1935. Jeff Masters, a meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections, says there are a few reasons Nicole form so late. The East Coast had a very warm fall. And high-level winds of the Atlantic, which can limit hurricane formation, weren't as strong as usual. And we're in a period of global warming, where the ocean temperatures are warmer than they've ever been, about 1.2 degrees centigrade warmer climate than back in the 1800s. With warmer ocean temperatures, Master says we've been seeing hurricanes form earlier than past years. And as Nicole has shown, we're likely to see them forming later in the season.

Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting rapidly, and that melt will accelerate as the Earth heats up. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, The goal of the international climate meeting underway in Egypt is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to temperatures in the late 1800s. Even at that level, communities will experience more dangerous storms, flooding and heat waves., But if the planet heats up beyond 1.5 degrees, the impacts don't get just slightly worse. Scientists warn that abrupt changes could be set off, with devastating impacts around the world., Credit: NASA, Such changes are sometimes called climate tipping points, although they're not as abrupt as that term would suggest. Most will unfold over the course of decades. Some could take centuries. Some may be partially reversible or avoidable. But they all have enormous and lasting implications for the humans, plants and animals on Earth. And they are looming., It's still possible to avoid such widespread calamities, but only if countries move far more aggressively to cut the pollution driving climate change. The Earth has warmed about 1 degree Celsius so far. If countries, including the United States, follow through on current promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the latest estimates suggest that Earth's temperature will still top out around 2.8 degrees Celsius of warming., Here are the three most important and well-studied changes, from collapsing ice sheets to thawing Arctic permafrost, to disappearing coral reefs., A group of scientists from the United Kingdom trek up to a research site on the west side of the Greenland ice sheet near Kangerlussuaq in the summer of 2022. This year marks the 26th year that Greenland has lost more ice than it gained. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, A group of scientists from the United Kingdom trek up to a research site on the west side of the Greenland ice sheet near Kangerlussuaq in the summer of 2022. This year marks the 26th year that Greenland has lost more ice than it gained., Change #1: Ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica could collapse, Ice sheets are the massive expanses of ice that cover Greenland and Antarctica, and which contain about two thirds of the freshwater on Earth. Climate change is already causing them to melt, and raising sea levels around the world., But if the Earth lingers at, or above, 2 degrees Celsius of warming, as it is on track to, that melting will steadily accelerate. Scientists warn that will cause parts of the ice sheets to collapse, sending massive amounts of water into the world's oceans., The million dollar question is how quickly that collapse will occur. ""Collapse tends to be a bit of a loaded world. People think of it like a building collapse,"" says Ian Joughin, a glaciologist at the University of Washington who has spent decades studying how giant glaciers move and change., ""Maybe a better timescale for an ice sheet [collapsing] is the Roman Empire,"" Joughin explains. Like a dying empire, the ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica are huge. It will take decades or even centuries for them to disintegrate., Snow and ice are melting more quickly than they are being replaced on the world's largest ice sheets. That's causing the ice sheets to get out of balance and rapidly destabilize, sending enormous amounts of freshwater into the ocean and driving global sea level rise. Ryan Kellman/NPR hide caption, This year marks the 26th year that Greenland has lost more ice than it gained. Last year, rainfall was recorded at the ice sheet's highest point, rather than snow, a sign that warmer temperatures were triggering widespread melting., As temperatures continue to warm, scientists say the two-mile thick ice sheet is getting out of balance. Snow and ice are melting faster than they're being replaced, and as the ice melt accelerates, the process is difficult to stop. One study found that no matter how humans cut greenhouse gas emissions going forward, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet is likely to cause 10 inches of sea level rise., Research suggests that the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet may already be underway. A massive glacier there, which covers an area about the size of the state of Washington, is melting quickly in response to climate change, and could splinter into the ocean in the coming decades., The Getz Ice Shelf in West Antarctica. Scientists are working to figure out exactly how quickly ice in West Antarctica is collapsing into the sea. The answer has profound implications for coastal communities around the world. Jeremy Harbeck/NASA hide caption, If that glacier melts entirely, it will add so much water to the oceans that sea levels will rise about 2 feet. If the entire West Antarctic ice sheet melts, scientists estimate that sea levels will rise about 12 feet., Due to their enormous size, ice sheets have a huge amount of inertia. Once the melt process gets underway, it's difficult to stop., ""It takes a few hundred years to really get going,"" says Joughin. ""And it's kind of a snowball effect, where the faster it goes, the more it's going to go."", But it will take a long time for people around the world to feel the most extreme effects of that melt. ""It could be anywhere from two or three hundred years to a thousand years,"" says Joughin., If humans slow down the pace of global warming, it will help slow down the pace of ice melting, giving the billions of people who live along coastlines more time to adapt., Change #2: Permanently frozen ground could thaw, Climate change is causing permafrost – the permanently frozen ground in the Arctic – to thaw. And as the Earth approaches 2 degrees Celsius of warming, that thawing ground will cause both local and global problems., Let's start local. When permafrost thaws, the ice that's trapped in the ground turns into water and drains away. ""It can have really profound consequences,"" says Merritt Turetsky, the director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, Boulder. ""We can see lakes draining overnight. We can see ecosystems becoming much drier in some areas, because the permafrost was actually holding the water up at the surface."", That's because when the ground is frozen, it's impermeable to moisture, like the lining of a bathtub. ""When it thaws, we pull the drain out of the bathtub,"" Turetsky explains., Scientist Keith Larson walks past a pond formed by thawing permafrost in Sweden. Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, Thawing permafrost has profound impacts for the millions of people who live in the Arctic. In many places, the land is sinking as it thaws, cracking the foundations of buildings, buckling roads and runways and kinking pipelines. That will accelerate as the Earth heats up more., Thawing permafrost also has global climate implications. Permanently frozen ground is like the world's freezer: millennia of dead plants and animals are locked up in permafrost., ""When permafrost thaws it's a little like losing power to your freezer. That food starts to rot,"" explains Ted Schuur, a permafrost expert at Northern Arizona University. Bacteria and fungi start to digest the carbon-rich soil, releasing planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere., Basically, it's an infinite loop of greenhouse gasses: human emissions cause the planet to heat up. That heat thaws permafrost, which releases more emissions., But how much extra carbon ultimately gets released by Arctic permafrost in the future is up to humans. ""The faster we can decarbonize society today, the more permafrost carbon we can keep in the Arctic ground where it belongs,"" says Turetsky. For example, by using renewable energy instead of burning fossil fuels., But, she warns, there will be a lag: the warming that has already occurred will keep thawing permafrost for decades. ""Our climate warming today is going to thaw permafrost and cause that permafrost to lose carbon 50 years from now,"" Turetsky explains., Change #3: Coral reefs could be gone forever, By overall area, coral reefs are a tiny part of the ocean. But they're a bedrock ecosystem for marine life, supporting an estimated 25% of all species., Corals are highly sensitive to heat, and as the oceans warm, the future of reefs is in peril. When marine heat waves hit, corals under stress expel their algae companions, which they need to survive. The reefs turn a ghostly white color., A bleaching event doesn't necessarily mean the end for a coral reef. Corals have the ability to recover, given enough time. But repeated heat waves, as seen at Australia's Great Barrier Reef, can kill a reef, leading to the collapse of the ecosystem., Bleaching coral in Kahala'u Bay in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Corals are highly sensitive to heat, and as the oceans warm, the future of reefs is in peril. Caleb Jones/AP hide caption, Oceans are also becoming more acidic, as they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit from burning fossil fuels. That also stresses corals, making it difficult for them to build their skeletons., If the world passes 2 degrees Celsius of heating, an estimated 99% of the world's coral reefs could be lost. The damage is happening faster than scientists expected. Combined with the effects of pollution and human development, half of all reefs worldwide will be in unlivable conditions by 2035, according to a new study., ""The coming decades will bring, I think, unprecedented change for both these reef systems and humanity in general,"" says Erik Franklin, professor at Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, who worked on the study., It's estimated that half a billion people around the world depend on coral reefs for food, income and livelihoods. Losing reefs would destabilize many countries, along with risking extinction for marine life that can only be found on coral reefs., ""There's entire societies and economies that are built around reef systems, especially in equatorial and tropical regions,"" Franklin says. ""So these societies will be in dire straits."", Many scientists are searching for ""refuges"" – pockets of the ocean where conditions might remain livable for coral reefs. The hope is that coral reefs can hold on there, surviving just long enough until humans can get their heat-trapping emissions under control.",Climate

A carbon credit represents a set amount of emissions that were reduced or removed from the atmosphere. Companies buy credits to offset their own emissions., Details of the State Department plan are still being worked out, but it appears countries would generate credits by cutting emissions in their power sectors through the retirement of fossil fuel infrastructure like coal plants and the addition of renewable energy. Countries would then be able to sell the credits to companies. Those transactions would create a reliable source of money for low-income countries, which they could use to obtain additional private funding on favorable terms, the U.S. State Department said in a statement., Critics say carbon markets — the places where carbon credits are bought and sold — often fail to deliver climate benefits. Many climate advocates say low-income countries need to get money directly in the form of grants that don't further strain their national budgets., ""Carbon offsets are not an answer in a world already on fire, under water and facing mounting climate losses and damage,"" said Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists., Now that most world leaders have made their opening statements, it's time to get down to business. But there appears to be little agreement about who will pay for the immense damage that climate change is causing, especially in developing countries. Wealthy countries, whose pollution has contributed the most to climate change, have agreed to discuss creating a loss and damage fund for developing countries at these talks, but an official decision could still be years away., Tens of millions of people were affected by climate-driven floods in Pakistan earlier this year. The country's climate minister Sherry Rehman said the cost is at least $30 billion – an astronomical sum that Pakistan cannot afford., Rehman and other delegates from around the world were theoretically supposed to keep their comments today to just a 2-minute opening statement. But Rehman spoke for much longer, arguing that countries must agree to at least talk about loss and damage funding., ""If we delay,"" Rehman said as one of the organizers interrupted to tell her that her time had expired. ""Yes,"" she responded, ""times up. Times up for everything, frankly."", ""[If we delay] putting loss and damage on an actionable agenda with a framework,"" she continued, ""then the signal we're sending each other and the rest of the world is that vulnerability is a death sentence."", Watch Rehman's full remarks here, starting at about 1:37:15., A handful of countries have announced new funding to support loss and damage in recent days. New Zealand is putting up $20 million and Austria offered 50 million euros. Germany and Denmark also announced more than 170 million euros for the ""Global Shield,"" a new fund that would provide disaster assistance and climate insurance to developing countries., Still, only half a dozen countries have made such commitments so far, and official negotiations over loss and damage are likely to be heated in the week ahead., The website is called Climate Trace, and it shows the exact sources of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide., The inventory is based on measurements from satellites, and sensors on land and on airplanes and ships. That's important because much of the self-reported data from industry about carbon dioxide and especially about methane pollution is notoriously unreliable., The new website shows that power plants and oil and gas fields are by far the biggest sources of emissions worldwide. For example, 26 of the 50 largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions are oil and gas operations., Methane – the predominant ingredient in natural gas – is a particularly big problem, because it's an incredibly potent greenhouse gas. It traps a ton of heat in the atmosphere. Oil and gas operations in the U.S. underreport how much methane they release, recent research suggests., The new website shows that there are oil and gas emissions hotspots in the U.S., Russia and the Middle East. You can browse the map yourself here., The goal of the new website is to publicize where planet-warming emissions come from, and make it harder for governments and companies to make vague promises to reduce those emissions., Conference attendees walk past the Mona Blue Pacific Pavilion at the conference. Sean Gallup/Getty Images hide caption, The U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which works with investors in the private sector to get money to low-income nations, says it's trying to boost investments to help countries deal with the impacts they're already feeling from climate change., According to the United Nations, industrialized countries gave developing nations around $29 billion in financing in 2020 to help them prepare for more extreme storms, heat waves and floods. But that's just a fraction of what the developing world needs in order to reduce the damage from extreme weather events, the report says., The Development Finance Corp. says it's looking to support small- and medium-sized businesses that have plans to improve climate adaptation in the areas of agriculture, water, infrastructure and health., ""DFC committed more than $390 million for climate adaptation projects during the last fiscal year.

In some cases, there are concerns that credits are double counted, which happens when two parties are able to claim the emissions reductions from a single credit. That leads to overstating the credit's actual environmental benefit., Under the State Department initiative, emissions reductions would serve two purposes: Creating carbon credits to sell to private investors, and helping low-income countries meet their international climate pledges, known as nationally determined contributions., .S. official said the plan would comply with guidelines set out in the Paris Agreement on climate change that are intended to prevent double counting., Some climate experts said the plan is still problematic., Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists said it's inconsistent with the need to make ""steep, absolute emission reductions as soon as possible"" in order to limit global warming., ""Carbon offsets are not an answer in a world already on fire, under water and facing mounting climate losses and damage,"" Cleetus said in a statement., Many climate advocates say low-income countries need to get money directly in the form of grants that don't further strain their national budgets., ""That's what the U.S. must deliver, rather than questionable carbon offset schemes that risk allowing companies to pollute at the expense of the planet,"" Cleetus said., Robin Rix, an executive at Verra, a nonprofit that sets standards for carbon markets, said the U.S. plan needs ""rigorous"" guidelines to attract private investors and ensure money isn't going to projects that would have otherwise gotten funding., The U.S. announced its plan a day after the United Nations took aim at companies that use ""dishonest climate accounting"" practices., The U.N. said in a report released during its annual climate conference that companies that have promised to eliminate or offset their carbon emissions should cut their own emissions instead of buying carbon credits whose effectiveness is hard to verify., The State Department said its new program could be limited to companies that have committed to eliminating or offsetting their emissions by 2050, with science-based interim targets. The department said it is considering other measures to ""promote environmental integrity"" in how the credits are used., The program is expected to run through 2030, with the possibility to extend it to 2035, the department said., ""Done right, leveraging voluntary carbon markets can help unlock billions of dollars from the private sector to accelerate the energy transition,"" Ani Dasgupta, CEO of World Resources Institute, said in a statement. However, there's ""a reason that carbon offsets have been associated with greenwashing, which must absolutely be avoided.""",Climate

Rodger Bosch/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, At this year's U.N. climate conference, a major focus is boosting investment in developing countries. Experts say renewable energy projects like this wind farm in South Africa can be attractive to private investors., One of the thorniest issues at the United Nations' annual climate negotiations in Egypt is how to get money to low-income countries to help them cope with climate change., Governments of industrialized countries, whose emissions have largely driven global warming, have pledged help. But public funds alone can't cover the trillions of dollars developing countries need to deal with rising temperatures., Many private investors see big opportunities to propel — and profit from — the fight against climate change. Yet little of their money is going to poorer nations, which already bear the brunt of extreme weather despite contributing little of the pollution that fuels climate change., ""I think there the story is not good. And that's because most of the big funds — pension funds, asset managers, new tech funds — they invest in advanced economies,"" says Bella Tonkonogy, a director at the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that works with governments and businesses to promote economic growth while addressing climate change. ""There's a lot that needs to be done to make it viable for that kind of big money now being raised to be invested in emerging economies."", A big barrier to private investment is the perception that risks in developing countries are greater than in industrialized nations. To better manage cross-border challenges like climate change, government leaders say it's time to overhaul institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which use money from the public sector to attract private investment to emerging economies., But world leaders say it's also in the private sector's interest to play a bigger role in helping poorer nations deal with climate change., ""I'm not here to tell the private sector to give up caring about profits,"" Philip Davis, prime minister of the Bahamas, said at the U.N. climate conference. ""I'm here to say that in a world of profound instability, your profits are very much in danger."", Investors in private markets and on public stock exchanges plowed $165 billion into climate technology companies in 2021, according to BloombergNEF, roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product of Algeria., While it's difficult to track and compare sources of climate funding, that's vastly more money than developing countries have been getting from private investors. Of the $83.3 billion in climate financing that went to developing nations in 2020, just $13.1 billion was from private sources, according to the latest data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development., Experts say the bulk of that private funding is being used for things like energy and transport projects that are aimed at reducing emissions in developing countries. That's because they tend to create more direct revenues for investors than adaptation projects like building flood defenses, which are designed to help countries cope with warming that's already happening., The Bahamas' Prime Minister Philip Davis warned that climate change threatens corporate profits. Ahmad Gharabli /AFP via Getty Images hide caption, The Bahamas' Prime Minister Philip Davis warned that climate change threatens corporate profits., ""The key opportunity area right now for private finance is very much renewable energy,"" says Amar Bhattacharya, who is part of an independent group of experts that was convened ahead of COP27 to advise conference leaders on how to increase climate financing. ""But there isn't a kind of ready-made highway, as yet, for the flow of large private finance into emerging and developing countries' investment opportunities."", Africa, for example, accounts for a large share of the world's potential solar development but attracts just a small fraction of renewable energy investment, says Enja Sæthren, head of government affairs at Scatec ASA, a project developer with a lot of experience in developing countries. Plenty of investors are willing to back projects in Africa that produce reliable profits, Sæthren says. However, those sorts of deals can be hard to come by because they require developers with ""strong market knowledge and a network to navigate different stakeholders,"" she says., A lack of infrastructure is also a problem. In some places, project developers are finding they can't build at the scale they would like, because there hasn't been enough public investment to expand local electric grids, said Katie Auth of the Energy for Growth Hub, which promotes energy policies that align with countries' development goals, in Washington, D.C. in October., That underscores the need for governments and development banks to create the right conditions for private investment., Multilateral development banks like the World Bank give financial and technical support to developing nations, which can help to reduce risk and attract private investors., But many say the system needs updating to draw the private investment required to fight climate change. Of the roughly $2.6 trillion needed annually over the next few years to eliminate or offset planet-warming emissions by midcentury, 70% could come from the private sector, says Citi, the U.S. bank., Despite their mandate to eliminate poverty, development banks tend to focus too much on avoiding risk and earnings profits, says Jacqueline Novogratz, the CEO of Acumen, a firm that invests in developing countries. What they should be doing is trying to attract as much private investment as possible to developing countries to ""make real change,"" she says., In October, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called for international development banks to rethink how they incentivize investment, especially for global challenges like climate change that span national borders. That could include issuing more grants instead of loans to provide funding. ""If the global community benefits from investments in climate, then the global community should help bear the cost,"" Yellen said in prepared remarks at Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C., U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry has echoed Yellen, saying the world needs to ""reimagine"" the system of development banks that emerged after World War II., ""Public finance is an indispensable component, mostly to unlock private investment on the scale that is needed in order to finance the energy revolution — to de-risk, to create blended finance,"" Kerry said in October at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C., ""We need a greater synergy between public and private finance,"" Kerry added. ""It's been talked about for a long time; it's got to happen."", In a joint statement at the start of the UN climate conference, a group of 10 development banks including the World Bank and European Investment Bank, said that increasing private investment in low-income countries is among their ""critical priorities."" The banks say they're focused on reducing financial risk and ensuring countries have plenty of attractive projects to offer investors., For those looking for a breakthrough at this year's climate conference in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, the United Nations meetings often feature big announcements. But turning promises into action has been the problem., ""My frustration is often that we speak with these grand statements: What needs to be done, what we will stand for,"" Novogratz says. ""What we need to do is start to put together real [investment programs], real promises, to enable those organizations that know how to execute on the ground."", A deal unveiled Monday at COP27 offers a glimpse of what that might look like., Africa's SouthBridge Investments and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa say they're creating a $2 billion fund to offer grants and loans to communities and entrepreneurs that are restoring land in Africa. Most of the money is coming from private investors. The Bezos Earth Fund is chipping in $50 million of philanthropic funding., Ani Dasgupta, CEO of World Resources Institute, says the new investment fund is a ""breakthrough"" in getting money directly into the hands of local businesses and nonprofits., ""Africa is a youthful continent,"" Frannie Leautier, CEO of SouthBridge Investments, said in a statement. ""Faced with crises, it has evolved to be the innovation factory of the Earth.""",Climate

Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP hide caption, Sandbags are distributed at Mills Pond Park in Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday ahead of subtropical storm Nicole., MIAMI — Tropical Storm Nicole churned toward the northwestern Bahamas and Florida's Atlantic coastline on Tuesday and was forecast to develop into a hurricane over the next couple of days, forecasters said., A range of warnings and watches remain in place. Many areas are still reeling from damage caused by Hurricane Ian, which hit Florida's southwestern Gulf Coast as a Category 4 storm in late September before dumping heavy amounts of rain across much of the central part of the state. Forecasters said heavy rain could fall on areas still recovering from Ian's flooding., Hurricane warnings were in effect for the Abacos, Berry Islands, Bimini and Grand Bahama Island, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. Other areas of the Bahamas, including Andros Island, New Province and Eleuthera remained under a tropical storm warning., Residents in at least three Florida counties — Flagler, Palm Beach and Volusia — were ordered to evacuate from barrier islands, low-lying areas and mobile homes. The evacuation orders are set to take effect Wednesday. Officials at Orlando International Airport, the seventh busiest in the U.S., said commercial operations would stop Wednesday afternoon until it was safe to resume flights., ""This incoming storm is a direct threat to both property and life,"" said Volusia County Manager George Recktenwald. ""Our infrastructure, particularly along the coastline, is very vulnerable because of Hurricane Ian."", In the Bahamas, long lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores earlier Tuesday, said Eliane Hall, who works at a hotel in Great Abaco island., ""We just boarded it up,"" she said of the hotel, adding that the impact of Hurricane Dorian, a Category 5 storm that struck in 2019, was still fresh in many people's minds. ""We're still affected,"" she said., Authorities said they were especially concerned about those now living in about 100 motorhomes in Grand Bahama after Dorian destroyed their homes, and about the migrant community in Great Abaco's March Harbor that Russell said has grown from 50 acres (20 hectares) to 200 acres (81 hectares) since Dorian. The previous community of Haitian migrants was among the hardest hit by the 2019 storm given the large number of flimsy structures in which many lived., Signs promoting candidates for Fort Myers Beach town council sit along a roadside on Estero Island, which was heavily damaged in September's Hurricane Ian, in Fort Myers Beach, Fla., on Tuesday. Rebecca Blackwell/AP hide caption, Signs promoting candidates for Fort Myers Beach town council sit along a roadside on Estero Island, which was heavily damaged in September's Hurricane Ian, in Fort Myers Beach, Fla., on Tuesday., The hurricane center said the storm's track shifted slightly north overnight, but the exact path remains uncertain as it approaches Florida, where it is expected to make landfall as a Category 1 hurricane late Wednesday or early Thursday., By Tuesday afternoon, hurricane warnings were issued for a large portion of Florida's Atlantic Coast, from Boca Raton to north of Daytona Beach. Tropical storm warnings are in place for other parts of the Florida coast, all the way to Altamaha Sound, Georgia. The warning area also stretches inland, covering Florida's Lake Okeechobee, with tropical storm watches in effect on the state's Gulf Coast from Bonita Beach in southwestern Florida to the Ochlockonee River in the Panhandle. The tropical storm watch extends north to the South Santee River in South Carolina., Bevin said the storm has a ""very large cyclonic envelope,"" meaning that even if it makes landfall along the central Florida coastline, the effects will be felt as far north as Georgia., However, the storm was not expected to have any impact on voting in Florida on Tuesday, Bevin said., Officials in the Bahamas opened more than two dozen shelters across the archipelago on Tuesday as they closed schools and government offices in Abaco, Bimini, the Berry Islands and Grand Bahama., Authorities warned that airports and seaports will close as the storm nears and not reopen until Thursday, and they urged people in shantytowns to seek secure shelter., Communities in Abaco are expected to receive a direct hit from Nicole as they still struggle to recover from Dorian., ""We don't have time to beg and plead for persons to move,"" said Capt. Stephen Russell, emergency management authority director., Some counties in Florida were offering sandbags to residents. In Indian River County, which is north of West Palm Beach, shelters were set to open at 7 a.m. Wednesday, though no mandatory evacuation orders had been issued by late morning Tuesday, said spokesman Mason Kozac., Any evacuations would be strictly voluntary, with residents ""having a conversation with themselves about whether they need to leave or not,"" Kozac said., The mandatory evacuation order in Palm Beach County affects 52,000 residents of mobile homes and 67,000 residents of barrier islands, officials said in an afternoon news conference. Shelters up and down the coast were opening at 7 a.m. Wednesday, officials said., Schools will be closed in multiple counties across Florida as the storm approaches. Some announced closures through Friday, already an off day because of the Veteran's Day holiday. Other districts have said they would cancel classes on Thursday. The University of Central Florida, one of the largest U.S. universities with 70,000 students and 12,000 employees, was closing on Wednesday and Thursday., Disney World outside Orlando planned to close its Typhoon Lagoon water park and two miniature golf courses on Thursday., In Seminole County, north of Orlando, Hurricane Ian caused unprecedented flooding, and officials are concerned the impending storm could bring a new round of flooding and wind damage., ""The water on the ground has saturated the root structures of many trees. The winds could bring down trees and those could bring down power lines,"" Alan Harris, Seminole County's emergency manager, said at a Tuesday news conference., In South Carolina, forecasters warned several days of onshore winds from Nicole could pile seawater into places like downtown Charleston. Thursday morning's high tide was predicted to be higher than the water level from Hurricane Ian., At 4 p.m. Tuesday, the storm was about 285 miles (460 kilometers) northeast of the northwestern Bahamas and 395 miles (640 kilometers) east of West Palm Beach, Florida. It was moving at moving at 10 mph (17 kph), with maximum sustained winds up to 65 mph (100 kph)., Tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 380 miles (610 kilometers) from the center of the storm, the National Hurricane Center's advisory said., The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. The last storm to hit Florida in November was Tropical Storm Eta, which made landfall in Cedar Key, on the state's Gulf Coast, on Nov. 12, 2020., Since record keeping began in 1853, Florida has had only two hurricanes make landfall in November, said Maria Torres, a spokesperson for the Hurricane Center.

He took the stage today, as well, explaining the impact of catastrophic flooding in Pakistan this summer. Peter Dejong/AP hide caption, International climate negotiations rolled on today in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt., The leaders of dozens of countries took the stage to describe how climate change is killing and injuring their citizens and hurting their economies. Scientists weighed in on how humans can adapt to a hotter planet. And the United Nations tried to crack down on companies that lie about how much they are reducing their greenhouse gas emissions., Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan took the floor to deliver an opening statement on behalf of his country. He opened with the grim details of catastrophic floods that hit Pakistan earlier this summer., Thirty three million people were affected, he said, more than half of whom are women and children. In the southern part of the country, seven times more rain than average fell., ""This all happened despite our very low carbon footprint,"" Sharif told assembled world leaders. ""And yet we became a victim of something with which we had nothing to do., ""This is simply unjust and unfair, to say the least,"" he continued. Sharif called on world leaders to come up with a fairer way for the wealthy countries responsible for current global warming to help pay for the costs of climate disasters., The U.N. is trying to prevent ""dishonest climate accounting"" by companies and local governments that have promised to eliminate or offset their carbon emissions., Non-state actors like financial institutions and city governments will play a crucial role in getting the world to net zero emissions by midcentury, a group of experts working on behalf of the U.N. said in a report. To ensure they're delivering on what they promised, groups that have made net-zero pledges must publicly report on their progress with verified information, the report says., The report also says groups that have made net-zero pledges should stop building or investing in new fossil fuel supplies, avoid buying ""cheap"" carbon offset credits instead of cutting their own emissions, and ensure their lobbying activities align with their climate commitments., ""A growing number of governments and non-state actors are pledging to be carbon free. And, obviously, that's good news,"" says António Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general. ""The problem is that the criterion benchmarks for these net-zero commitments have varying levels of rigor and loopholes wide enough to drive a diesel truck through."", Voters are heading to the polls to decide which party will control Congress, and the outcome could undermine the Biden Administration's negotiating clout in the climate talks over the next two weeks., The U.S. has already committed to cutting its emissions 50-52% by 2030. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which spurs the adoption of electric cars and more efficient buildings, is a major part of reaching that target and is already underway., ""If there is change in leadership in Congress, Congress is not going to be able to pass a repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act,"" says Dan Lashof, director of the World Resources Institute. ""That is a key bedrock of federal policy and importantly, most of it is self-executing."", According to the new ""America Is All In"" report, the U.S. is on track to cut emissions 39% by 2030, but would need to phase out coal completely by then to achieve its goal. But a major negotiating item at COP27 is over how to increase funding for developing countries to help them adapt to climate change and pay for the damage from climate impacts. If Democrats lose Congress, Republicans will likely oppose any climate aid for poorer countries., People who live in low-income and developing countries are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. That includes sea level rise, heavy rain and more extreme storms, droughts and heat waves., ""The impacts are here, they're now and they are impacting the most vulnerable,"" said Debra Roberts, a co-chair of the adaptation section of a sweeping international climate report released last year, at a presentation today at COP27., Roberts and other top climate scientists working for the United Nations warned that research about adapting to climate change focuses on wealthier nations. That disparity leaves millions of people without useful guidance, the scientists say., Last year's conference in Glasgow saw crowds of thousands of people gathered outside the conference center to push for climate action. Their voices could sometimes be heard inside the building. This year couldn't be more different., The Egyptian government said it would allow some protests. But it has limited demonstrators to a ring-fenced area several minutes drive from the conference center. And human rights groups say the government has heavily vetted those who have been given permission to protest., When NPR visited the protest site, there were only a few dozen demonstrators, and the event felt carefully controlled. As one foreign TV crew approached, one of the organizers quietly warned the protestors, who had been asked to stand in a line, to be careful what they said, even to each other, because the correspondent ""understands Arabic""., Rather than try to hold politicians at the conference accountable, people there seemed keen to voice their support for world leaders - in particular the Egyptian president Abdul Fattah El Sisi., Taher Salem, an employee in the Ministry of Education, said he'd come to the protest site to join President Sisi in ""welcoming people here from all over the world"". ""We are here to support the conference; to say welcome to Sharm el Sheikh; welcome to Egypt,"" he said., This scene is in keeping with Egypt's record on freedom of expression. The country has a record for the widespread stifling of dissent, with an estimated 60,000 political prisoners. Human Rights Watch says dozens of environmental activists have been arrested in the lead up to this summit., Despite these efforts, human rights are becoming a growing focus at the conference. Sanaa Seif, the sister of one of Egypt's best known political prisoners, Alaa Abd El Fattah, is attending to spotlight the case of her brother, who has been in jail for almost a decade., At the same time, Abd El Fattah has stepped up an ongoing hunger strike by now also refusing water.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, President Biden during the world leaders' summit at the UN COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on November 2, 2021., President Biden has pledged to direct $11 billion annually toward international climate aid by 2024, quadrupling the previous U.S. high-water mark., It is something that Biden has raised repeatedly in speeches to other world leaders, including during the United Nations General Assembly in September., ""To meet our global responsibility, my administration is working with our Congress to deliver more than $11 billion a year to international climate finance,"" Biden said then, ""to help lower-income countries implement their climate goals and ensure a just energy transition."", When Biden speaks about U.S. efforts to cut carbon emissions at the UN climate summit, COP27, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on Friday, Biden will reiterate that he wants to ""help the most vulnerable build resilience to climate impacts,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters., But it remains unclear whether the president will be able to meet his goal — particularly if Republicans make gains in midterm elections this week — because Congress has been reluctant to spend as much money as Biden has asked for., At past international climate summits, like the one Biden will attend this week, developed nations agreed to help less-developed and more vulnerable nations adapt to life on a hotter planet. Developed nations are historically the biggest emitters of greenhouse gasses , while developing nations have contributed very little to the planet's warming but are bearing the brunt of damages from at hotter, more unpredictable climate. This type of aid and investment is often referred to as ""climate finance."", The United States is the world's largest economy and largest cumulative emitter of greenhouse gas pollution. It has done more over time to warm the planet than any other nation, although China now emits more on a per-year basis., The United States, like other countries, is required to submit a report every two years to the United Nations documenting progress on its climate goals. The Trump administration did not file those reports for 2018 or 2020., A retroactive report, submitted by the Biden administration last year, said that the U.S. invested an average of $2.2 billion dollars yearly between 2015 and 2018 toward international climate finance., As for what the U.S. has contributed to climate finance under Biden, the totals haven't been officially tallied, but the portion appropriated by Congress has gone up during his tenure., In March of this year, Democrats in Congress passed a budget that allocated about $1 billion dollars to international climate aid efforts — $387 million more than the same budget items during the Trump administration, though far short of the $2.5 billion the White House had asked for, and many times less than Biden would need to meet his larger pledge., At a UN conference in 2009, 12 of the world's largest economies — including the United States — pledged to collectively mobilize at least $100 billion each year to international climate aid by 2020 from public and private sources., That pledge has never been met — and the countries have now extended the goal to 2025., In 2020, the most recent year for which complete data is available, developed nations mobilized roughly $83 billion toward climate finance, a mixture of both government grants and loans as well as private dollars., Compared to the other countries involved, the U.S. invests a lot of money in terms of total dollars, but a comparatively small amount relative to the size of its economy., An analysis from the World Resources Institute, which works to advance international climate action, estimates that a ""fair share"" for the U.S. of the big economies' $100 billion pledge would be somewhere between $40 billion and $47 billion annually, taking into account the size of its economy and its historic contribution to global warming., The $11 billion in annual climate finance aid that Biden has promised — and the $100 billion that the United States has pledged collectively with other world economies — would be a major resource to help the poorest nations adapt to and mitigate damages caused by a warming planet., Advocates see it as a good-faith commitment, a sign that the U.S. and other major emitters are taking the problem seriously., But as a UN report laid out earlier this month, the pledge still is many times lower than the full amount needed to tackle the immense, global challenges posed by the climate crisis., The administration has two main sources of funds it hopes to draw from: appropriated funding from Congress, and money from federal development agencies., The White House would like Congress to provide $5.3 billion, or roughly half the total pledge, to help specific countries and to support large, international efforts like the Green Climate Fund., Administration officials hope the second half will come from sources like the Export-Import Bank and the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), government agencies that use financial instruments like loans and insurance to advance U.S. policy goals abroad., The first — and most immediate — hurdle that Biden faces is Congress. Passing any funding bill requires 60 votes to clear the Senate. That means Democrats need to convince some Republican lawmakers to join them., The White House asked Congress for $5.3 billion in funding in its 2023 budget request in March, which would be enough, in combination with anticipated development finance money, to meet the president's pledge. But it is a big jump from what Congress has done in the past — roughly five times what it allotted for 2022., Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, denounced the White House's proposal as ""another pipe dream of liberal activism and climate extremism."", And since the budget was released in the spring, the headwinds facing the administration have only gotten stronger. Inflation has remained stubbornly high, and some economists worry that interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve could lead to a recession., That would mean that adding billions in international climate aid could be a tough pill for some lawmakers — even some Democrats — to swallow., Government development agencies are another source of money for Biden's pledge. The government invests in projects abroad through agencies like the Export-Import Bank and the International Development Finance Corporation, which lend out money and look to generate a return on their investments., The Export-Import Bank and DFC support their work largely through the fees and returns they make on their loans and other programs, rather than through money they receive from Congress., It's possible that these agencies could scale up their spending on climate-focused programs to help meet the president's pledge, according to Bella Tonkonogy of the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit policy research organization., But Tonkonogy warned that it isn't just about whether the government can find the money. There is also the question of whether these agencies can quickly identify and vet quality projects., ""That will require working differently — from developing comprehensive climate strategies, to building up staff capacity, to partnering with other agencies,"" Tonkonogy said.",Climate

That includes leaders from hundreds of nations.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres did not mince words in his opening remarks. ""We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator,"" he warned., He also referenced the fact that the global population is expected to officially hit 8 billion people during this climate meeting. ""How will we answer when baby 8-billion is old enough to ask 'What did you do for our world, and for our planet, when you had the chance?'"" Guterres asked a room full of world leaders., There's a new United Nations plan to warn people around the world about climate-related hazards like extreme storms and floods. It's called Early Warning for All., About half the world isn't covered by multi-hazard early warning systems, which collect data about disaster risk, monitor and forecast hazardous weather, and send out emergency alerts, according to the U.N., Coverage is worst in developing countries, which have been hit hardest by the effects of global warming., The new plan calls for $3.1 billion to set up early-warning systems over the next five years in places that don't already have them, beginning with the poorest and most vulnerable countries and regions. More money will be needed to maintain the warning systems longer-term., Multiple world leaders voiced their frustration that wealthy countries, including the United States, are not paying enough for the costs of climate change. At these talks, developing countries are pushing for compensation for the damages from extreme storms and rising seas, what's known as ""loss and damage."", The U.S. is the country most responsible for current global warming because of past greenhouse gas emissions., The Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Amor Mottley, went one step further in her opening speech to fellow leaders. She called out corporations that profit in our fossil-fuel intensive economy, including oil and gas companies themselves., Those corporations should help pay for the costs associated with sea level rise, stronger hurricanes, heat waves and droughts around the world, she argued, and especially in places like her nation that are extremely vulnerable to climate change and don't have the money to protect themselves., The performance at the end of a multi-hour session with world leaders was about 3 minutes long and told the story of global warming., Watch it for yourself here., The U.S. government is working with AT&T, a telecommunications company, to provide free access to data about the country's future climate risks. The idea is to help community leaders better understand and prepare for local dangers from more extreme weather., The Climate Risk and Resilience Portal will initially provide information about temperature, precipitation, wind and drought conditions. Additional risks such as wildfire and flooding will be added in the coming months., ""We want other organizations and communities to see where they're potentially vulnerable to climate change and take steps to become resilient,"" Charlene Lake, AT&T's chief sustainability officer, said in a news release., More than two dozen countries say they'll work together to stop and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030 in order to fight climate change., Chaired by the United States and Ghana, the Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership includes 26 countries and the European Union, which together account for more than one-third of the world's forests., More than 140 countries agreed at COP26 last year in Glasgow to conserve forests and other ecosystems. However, the U.N. said on Monday that not enough money is being spent to preserve forests, which capture and store carbon., To encourage accountability, the Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership says it will hold annual meetings and publish progress reports.",Climate

Over the next two weeks, around 100 world leaders, including President Joe Biden, are expected to speak at the COP 27 conference. It's being held in the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. And questions are being raised about why that country should be the host. NPR's Ruth Sherlock joins us from there now. Hey, Ruth. Hi. So, Ruth, today, the conference heard a warning from the head of the United Nations. Can you tell us about that? Antonio Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, used his opening remarks to remind the world of the urgency of what's being discussed here. Take a listen. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator. So he said much of this conference should be about what he called a climate solidarity pact, where emerging and developed economies work together to lower carbon emissions. He said the only alternative to climate solidarity is, and I quote, ""collective suicide"". What are some of the topics being discussed at COP 27 so far? Well, one key discussion here will be the question of loss and damage. That's the debate over whether, and how, wealthier countries that are responsible for most of the carbon dioxide emissions should pay reparations to emerging economies. Some of those economies have been hit the hardest by climate change, with things like flooding and agricultural loss through drought. But it's a sort of tug of war between rich and developing economies. Many wealthier nations have resisted addressing this because they fear massive liabilities. Some say the cost of those losses could be hundreds of billions of dollars per year.One concrete development from today, though, is that the U.N. has announced an early warning system to forecast dangerous weather, like extreme storms and floods around the world. And that's going to focus, first, on helping the poorest and most vulnerable populations. And we do expect some developments in the drive to cut global carbon emissions. And next week, leaders are supposed to try to work on a joint statement for all countries. As I mentioned, some have questioned whether Egypt is the right choice to host this summit. It's a country criticized by human rights groups for its repression of freedom of speech and human rights violations. How do you think this will impact the conference? Well, you know, it's a real issue here. I mean, Human Rights Watch says that dozens of environmental activists have been arrested in the lead-up to this summit. They say that Egypt does allow, you know, some activism on some climate-related topics, but other issues, like major government infrastructure projects or industrial pollution, are red lines. And experts I've spoken with here today say that these arrests have had this kind of chilling effect, with many local organizations choosing to stay quiet, not to protest.Past global climate gatherings have been these lively and energetic events, with crowds of thousands of people gathered outside the conference halls trying to push for change. But there's none of that here. I'm told that some protests will be allowed but only for a small number of protesters that have been carefully vetted. And they're going to be kept in a designated area that I'm told is some distance from the entrance of the conference hall. I should say, though, that some people are using this conference as an opportunity to try to kind of highlight the cases of jailed activists. The sister of Alaa Abd El-Fattah, the Egyptian British activist who's been jailed for much of the past decade, well, she's come to the conference to try to push for his release. That's NPR's Ruth Sherlock in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Thank you. Thank you. ",Climate

""These disasters displace three times more people than war.

It's a follow-up to last year's gathering, where countries set targets for cutting greenhouse emissions in an effort to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Despite those targets, a recent U.N. report showed the world's nations are far from reaching their goals. Joining me now to talk about the conference and what we can expect is Janine Felson. She's an ambassador and climate negotiator from Belize who negotiates on behalf of small island nations. Ambassador Felson, welcome back to . Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be with you. The climate conference starts tomorrow. What are one or two of your main priorities heading into these talks? It's very important that we move from just plain promises and commitments that we've heard in Glasgow to actual results. I think this will be a big issue coming out of Sharm el-Sheikh, whether we can see results given the fact that we are in a very complicated, complex political environment with many issues cropping up with diversion of attention on the multilateral agenda to matters that veer away from climate. Whether or not we can see results from Sharm el-Sheikh is the big question for us. But we're certainly looking at priorities around finance, around raising ambition and finally addressing issues on loss and damage. Can you say a little bit more about what loss and damage is? Loss and damage is one of these terms that we use in the context of the climate change process that basically refers to what we in small island developing states refer to as permanent and irreversible losses - so cultural, territorial and even health-related losses. But what we're seeing really with the impact from climate change is the fact that islands are being submerged, cultures are going to be decimated with the mere movement of people from places where their national heritage is connected to. And these are issues that have not yet been addressed by climate change regime. One huge difference from last year's climate conference is the war in Ukraine. It's led to a big spike in energy prices that's led some countries to consider tapping new sources of fossil fuels. How is this new reality affecting negotiations this year? It's a very important issue because we've listened to many claims of ambitious action being taken, and yet we now see a regression and a call on fossils as a new type of bridge in fuel. And I think there have been quite a number of reports out already that have stated that if you turn to gas, if you revive coal, you continue to put money into other fossil fuels, this is not going to be a bridge to a future that sees limits on 1.5. What you could see are stranded assets or just further locking in a global warming that will exceed 1.5 and create absolute chaos for the world. You know, I'm seeing a lot of pessimism among experts in the press about how much this conference can actually achieve this year, given high inflation, the war in Ukraine. You represent small island nations, which aren't the most powerful nations at these conferences. How do you hold bigger nations accountable and apply the pressure for them to set the kind of targets you want to see? I think it's fair to say that this is a very difficult context to take major political decisions. And I think it's also important to recognize that this conference will be taking decisions on processes that are aimed to address the concerns of how exactly do we support countries make those breakthroughs on - in sectors like energy or transportation? How exactly do we support countries tap into finances that could better support a resilience? So I think it will be a lot more process based rather than those big political commitments that we saw in Glasgow. How will you know if you've been successful this year? I think the test of success is where we land on the reaffirmation of the commitment to 1.5. I think there's a really important narrative that has to come out from COP 27, and that's where governments agree that we're not going to be stepping backwards from where we ended in Glasgow, but we will be going forward. For small island developing states, the litmus tests will be having the opportunity to put loss and damage finance on the agenda of the COP once and for all. I've been speaking with Janine Felson, a climate negotiator and ambassador from Belize. She joined us from Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where she's attending the U.N. climate conference on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States. Ambassador Felson, thanks for your time. Thank you, too.

https://www.npr.org/2022/11/05/1134557608/climate-change-hits-local-ballot-boxes,2022-11-05,Climate change hits local ballot boxes,,"We begin tonight's program focusing on two events that will shape the future of climate policy, the midterm elections and the U.N. Climate Conference, which starts tomorrow. In a minute, we'll hear from a climate negotiator who's attending the U.N. conference in Egypt. But first, we want to start our focus on the U.S. election. Issues like the economy and which party will take control of Congress have dominated election coverage. But the climate is also an issue showing up on many local ballots here in Tuesday's midterm elections.So to learn more about how these races could shape climate policy, we've called Rebecca Leber. She's a senior reporter for Vox who covers climate change. Welcome. Hi. I think a lot of people don't often think of climate change as an issue that gets decided at the local ballot box. Why should they? Yeah. We don't always think about state and local officials as really the people on the ground who are implementing climate policy. So this year, Congress passed this huge climate law and the Inflation Reduction Act, which means billions of dollars that are now going to go to local and state officials to actually implement. That's what makes these races so critical, even if they don't always get as much attention as the top of the ballot. Well, before we jump into specifics, would you say that there are common themes that emerge across the country when climate change does appear on local ballots? We're seeing the cycle - climate play a complicated role in the election. It may not be the most visible issue on the airways, but it's coming through in other debates like over energy and gas prices. Republicans are accusing Democratic incumbents of implementing policies that raise energy prices, while Democrats are accusing Republicans of being beholden to big oil and trying to boost oil profits. Well, let's jump into some of these local races then. I'd like to start in North Carolina, which, unlike most Southern states, actually has a plan to address climate change, including by promoting clean energy. Why will this election be so consequential for North Carolina's plan? This is one of the races I'm watching closest because in North Carolina, Republicans are just a few seats away from gaining a supermajority in the legislature. If they gain that, that means they have this veto-proof majority where they can overturn these kinds of executive orders and actions that North Carolina has to reverse, basically, what the state has done so far to make some progress on its flooding resiliency and its climate goals. So North Carolina is not the only state where Republicans could gain that supermajority, but it's certainly the most interesting one because we could see a true role reversal on climate. Even in conservative states, cities can get a lot done on climate policy. Tell me about Corpus Christi, Texas. Why is a city council race in a city of 300,000 people so consequential for climate policy? Corpus Christi is really important because it is a major site for exporting crude oil in the U.S. It actually gets lots of oil from the Permian Basin, the most active oil field in the country. And it is in the process of building all of this infrastructure that exports it to other countries. So it turns out that the city council has a really important say over the infrastructure getting built and who in the city has input into how it's built and whether it is even built or whether the city should focus more on boosting its clean energy.So this year, we're seeing the slate of climate candidates run for the city council. And if they do win, then we would see the city actually change its course from being fully beholden to oil interests, like we usually expect from Texas, to actually charting forward a more climate-friendly path that we might not expect in oil country. With potential implications for the state, the region and the whole country. Right. I think that's the important point here, that these are very local races, but they have outsized impact beyond their borders. You know, Rebecca, some of the things we hear from Republican candidates in these local races is that these local entities are not the places that are going to solve climate change. The Inflation Reduction Act, which the federal government passed over the summer, includes some landmark provisions to address climate change at a much bigger scale. What... You're seeing in a lot of these races the Republican candidates saying that this particular position or part of government shouldn't be responsible for climate change. But I'd argue the opposite - that this is actually the most important place to see climate policy in action because city and state officials are responsible for siting all kinds of projects, for deciding what gets built, for deciding whether a state or city even has clean energy goals that it's striving for.One other important point here is the federal government has to do a lot on climate in order to reach this goal of slashing U.S. pollution in half in a decade. But it's not the only part of this picture. Local action is so important here because it needs to go above and beyond the floor the federal government sets to get all the way to the U.S. as goals to cutting climate pollution. So it's important that local offices and the federal government are all working in the same direction. And if it's not, then the U.S. really doesn't have a shot for hitting those targets and addressing its climate pollution. Well, Rebecca Leber, thanks for following all these races for us. I've been speaking with Rebecca Leber, a senior reporter at Vox News who covers climate change. Thanks for your time. Thanks for covering it. ",Climate

Michael Probst/AP hide caption, Steam rises from the coal-fired power plant with wind turbines nearby in Niederaussem, Germany, as the sun rises on Nov. 2, 2022., BERLIN — When world leaders, diplomats, campaigners and scientists descend on Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt next week for talks on tackling climate change, don't expect them to part the Red Sea or other miracles that would make huge steps in curbing global warming., Each year there are high hopes for the two-week United Nations climate gathering and, almost inevitably, disappointment when it doesn't deliver another landmark pact like the one agreed 2015 in Paris., But those were different days, marked by a spirit of cooperation between the world's two biggest polluters — the United States and China — as well as a global realization that failure to reach an agreement would put humanity on a self-chosen track to oblivion., This November the geopolitical tiles have shifted: a devastating war in Ukraine, skyrocketing energy and food prices, and growing enmity between the West on the one hand and Russia and China on the other make for difficult conditions at a gathering that requires cooperation and consensus., ""There's a lot of high and low expectations around this Egypt COP, a lot of mix of ambition and fatalism,"" said Avinash Persaud, special envoy for the Barbados prime minister., Here's what to look out for during the 27th Conference of the Parties, or COP27, from Nov. 6-18 and why it might still end up being a success., Scientists are more concerned about global warming than three decades ago, when governments first came together to discuss the problem because the pace of warming in the past decade is 33% faster than in the 1990s., Greenhouse gas emissions are still rising, while tangible impacts from climate change are already being felt around the world., But there is some progress. Before Paris, the world was heading for 4.5 degrees Celsius (8.1 Fahrenheit) of warming by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times., Recent forecasts have that down to 2.6 C (4.7 F), thanks to measures taken or firm commitments governments have already made. That's far above the 1.5 C (2.7 F) limit countries agreed to seven years ago, however, and the time for keeping that target is fast running out., Researchers say the world has already warmed by 1.2 C (2.2F) and capping temperatures at 1.5 C would require emissions to drop by 43% by the end of the decade, a highly ambitious goal. To get to the less ambitious 2 C (3.6 F) goal emissions have to fall 27%., ""The 1.5 degrees is in intensive care and the machines are shaking. So, it is in high danger. But it is still possible,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. ""My objective in Egypt is to make sure that we gather enough political will to make this possibility really moving forward, to make the machines work ... We're getting close to moments where tipping points might, at a certain moment, make it irreversibly impossible to achieve. Let's avoid it at all costs."", Prices for oil, coal and natural gas have jumped since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Some countries have responded by trying to tap new sources of fossil fuel., This has raised concerns about governments backsliding on their commitments to cut emissions, including the agreement at last year's climate talks to ""phase down"" the use of coal and sharply reduce the amount of methane — a powerful greenhouse gas — released into the atmosphere., At the same time, rising fossil fuel prices have made renewable energy more competitive. Building solar and wind power plants remains more expensive for developing countries though. To help them cut their emissions quickly, rich nations are negotiating aid projects known as 'just transition energy partnerships', or JET-Ps, with several major emerging economies including Indonesia and India that could be finalized during or shortly after COP27., One of the big sticking points in past negotiations concerned the financial support poor countries receive from rich nations to cope with climate change., A deadline to provide $100 billion annually by 2020 was missed and now looks set to be achieved only next year. Future funding needs are likely to be in the trillions, not billions, said Mohamed Nasr, Egypt's lead negotiator., ""The gap on finance is huge,"" he said, noting that half the population of Africa doesn't yet have access to electricity, much less clean energy., Developed countries including the United States have also yet to make good on a pledge to double the amount they provide for adaptation, and make that half of the overall funding., Discussions on climate finance also include the highly contentious issue of countries being compensated for the irreparable harm they've suffered as a result of global warming. Big polluters have strongly opposed demands for 'loss and damage' payments in the past, but observers say they've seen a softening of positions recently, including by the United States., ""I think that people are not expecting miracles in terms of a huge fund just miraculously appearing, but they are expecting a credible, meaningful pathway,"" said Inger Andersen, head of the U.N. Environment Programme., This would give countries that have done very little to cause the climate crisis but are on the front line of dealing with it ""something to hold on to,"" she said., Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is not coming to this year's gathering and recently called the U.N. process a ""scam."", Other activists have also voiced frustration at the slow pace of negotiations, given the scale of the threat posed by climate change. But Harjeet Singh of Climate Action Network International said there is no other space where all countries are equal., ""Tuvalu theoretically is as powerful as the U.S. and Malawi as powerful as the European Union,"" he said of the talks. ""For us as civil society it's also a place to call out these countries, to call their bluff, to put a spotlight on those polluters and raise our voices."", University of Maryland social scientist Dana Fisher, who studies the environmental movement, said given Egypt's authoritarian government and an escalation of in-your-face tactics by frustrated protestors, especially youth, she would not be surprised if there are clashes., ""There's going to be a vanguard of them who are going to be willing to break the law and engage in probably what will start out as civil disobedience, peaceful civil disobedience,"" Fisher said. ""And they're probably going to get beaten up. And it's going to be very good for mobilizing sympathizers."", Egypt has insisted that campaigners will have ""full opportunity of participation, of activism, of demonstration, of voicing that opinion."", The gathering in Egypt will be the first time since 2016 that U.N. climate talks have taken place in Africa. Experts say it is important the continent gets more attention, given how heavily it is affected by rising temperatures., ""If we look at the 50 countries that are most vulnerable to climate change impacts and who have the least resilience, these are low income countries and most of them are in Africa,"" said Preety Bhandari of the World Resources Institute. ""So it is fortuitous that we are having this particular COP in Africa to highlight what the vulnerable countries are asking from the climate regime."", Campaigners say that recognizing the challenges Africa faces and prioritizing the needs of vulnerable countries is essential for a successful outcome this year.",Climate

It helps pay to link new homes to the natural gas system. And that is something climate scientists worry could lock in decades of climate-warming emissions. California recently scrapped these incentives, and now Colorado is considering a similar move. Colorado Public Radio's Sam Brasch reports. Thank you so much for showing up for a tour. About a dozen people are packed into a trailer at a construction site in Fort Collins, Colo. They grab hardhats, along with free coffee and doughnuts, to tour a brand-new neighborhood. It's a very thoughtfully and intentionally designed community. Stephen Myers is the CEO of Thrive Home Builders, which sells all-electric homes with zero need for natural gas. Whether it's cooking, whether it's heating, cooling - everything in that home is going to run off of electricity. We walk out of the trailer. Concrete foundations stretch towards the Rocky Mountain Foothills, some topped with wood frames and roofs. Climate groups love electric homes because they can draw their power from clean energy sources like wind and solar. And they have a plan to nudge developers to build more of them. In the first house, I break that plan down for Beth and Lee Zimmerman, who are shopping for a new home. So we retired a year ago. We moved to Fort Collins to be closer to our grandchildren. OK. So let me tell you what my story is about.This takes a second to explain, so bear with me. Like a lot of people, I get a gas bill. It includes what I pay for energy then all these little, like, fees and charges. Part of that money finances a discount to connect new homes to the gas system. Colorado regulators have proposed becoming the second state to ditch those subsidies, after California. The Zimmermans - they like the idea of pushing more developers to skip natural gas. With global warming, climate change, we need to, you know, be careful of, you know, how we proceed with future builds. And I think this company addresses that quite nicely. But some big utilities are cautious. Robert Kenney leads Xcel Energy, Colorado, the state's largest gas and power company. He says natural gas, it isn't going away. Our customers are still demanding it and still want it. People use it for cooking. It's also consistent with spurring economic development. Xcel Energy has joined homebuilders to defend the subsidy. Kenney insists that doesn't conflict with his company's ambitious climate goals. That's because it's investing in green technologies like mixing hydrogen into the gas supply. On that point, climate advocates are skeptical. We know that the most cost-effective way to eliminate emissions from buildings is through investing in efficient, all-electric appliances. Kiki Velez is a green building advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council. She says the subsidy is a terrible climate policy and adds to skyrocketing energy bills. It's bad for customers. It's costing them money. And it's also completely contradictory to our climate goals. California estimates eliminating the subsidy will save ratepayers there more than $160 million each year. Colorado gas customers could save more than 10 million annually if regulators go through with their proposal later this month.(CROSSTALK) Back in the trailer, I check in with Gene Myers, the chief sustainability officer for Thrive Home Builders. He doesn't have a prediction on the upcoming decision. I don't know what happens in the next few months with the PUC, but I think long term, the building industry is almost 40% of emissions. And so to me, it's inevitable. New York City and Berkeley, Calif., have already banned new gas hookups. He expects that trend will grow, and he thinks his company should learn to build all-electric homes now before it's required.For NPR News, I'm Sam Brasch in Denver. ",Climate

The mountain is seen here in 2009., In North America and around the globe, 50 UNESCO World Heritage sites are home to glaciers. A new study warns that glaciers in a third of them will disappear by 2050 due to carbon emissions warming the planet., The other two-thirds can still be saved — but only if global temperatures don't exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial times, UNESCO says., World Heritage sites are places that have outstanding natural and cultural heritage, and that world leaders have thus agreed to protect., UNESCO's report, released ahead of the COP27 climate conference starting Sunday in Egypt, is bracing., About 18,600 glaciers are found in World Heritage sites, and they represent about a tenth of the glacierized area on Earth — but they are shrinking quickly. The glaciers in these 50 sites are losing some 58 billion tons of ice each year, and contribute to almost 5% of observed sea level rise globally., The last remaining glaciers in Africa are predicted to melt by 2050, including those at Kilimanjaro National Park and Mount Kenya. The fastest melting glaciers on the list are those at Three Parallel Rivers National Park in China's Yunnan province. Glaciers there have already lost more than 57% of their mass since 2000., In the U.S., the ice bodies or glaciers in Yellowstone and Yosemite National Parks will likely have disappeared by 2050. The glaciers found along the U.S.-Canadian border at the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park have already lost more than a quarter of their volume in the last 20 years., Other endangered glaciers include those in Italy's Dolomites, France's Pyrenees, Argentina's Los Alerces National Park, Peru's Huascarán National Park, and New Zealand's Te Wahipounamu., The melting glaciers have an impact not only on the environment, but on people, said Bruno Oberle, director-general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature in a statement released Thursday., ""When glaciers melt rapidly, millions of people face water scarcity and the increased risk of natural disasters such as flooding, and millions more may be displaced by the resulting rise in sea levels,"" Oberle said., ""This study highlights the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions and invest in Nature-based Solutions, which can help mitigate climate change and allow people to better adapt to its impacts,"" he added., As the world's climate leaders gather for COP27, UNESCO is calling for the creation of an international fund for glacier monitoring and preservation that would support research, strengthen ties between stakeholders, and implement disaster risk and early warning measures., ""This report is a call to action,"" UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay said in statement. ""Only a rapid reduction in our CO2 emissions levels can save glaciers and the exceptional biodiversity that depends on them.""",Climate

Regenerative agriculture is a loosely defined term, but generally involves promoting on-farm soil health and carbon sequestration through practices like cover cropping and no-tilling. Phil Magakoe/AFP/Getty Images hide caption, A view of soybeans being planted on a farm in Balfour, South Africa on Oct. 20, 2021. Regenerative agriculture is a loosely defined term, but generally involves promoting on-farm soil health and carbon sequestration through practices like cover cropping and no-tilling., Will Cannon does more to sequester carbon than the average U.S. farmer., After he harvests his corn and soybeans, he plants cover crops, which sequester carbon all winter long, on his entire 1,000-acre operation in Prairie City, Iowa. He's avoiding tilling, or plowing, his soil as much as possible, which helps keep carbon stored in the ground., ""I've kind of had a passion for conservation all my life,"" he says. ""We've always been pushing the envelope on what we're trying to do."", Cannon is getting help to finance this climate-friendly way of farming, which costs him thousands of dollars for additional machinery and seed, from the kinds of companies that ultimately buy his product. Footing the bill in his case is PepsiCo and Unilever, which own food brands ranging from Lay's and Gatorade to Hellman's and Ben & Jerry's., This kind of cross-supply chain partnership could become increasingly common. A consortium of 12 food companies, including Mars, PepsiCo and McDonald's, announced a plan to scale up the amount of regenerative farmland. The plan was released just days before the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in Egypt., While the practices regenerative agriculture encompasses are nothing new, it's becoming an increasingly popular climate change mitigation tool, especially among mega food corporations., ""I think [regenerative agriculture] has a tremendous but under-tapped opportunity to have a major impact on climate change,"" says Jim Andrew, PepsiCo's chief sustainability officer., The food system accounts for a third of global greenhouse gas emissions and the private sector largely controls that system. Corporations, including Mars and PepsiCo, have made commitments to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. But the industry is inextricably tied to emissions, with an enormous, multi-million ton carbon footprint. Part of that stems from rampant deforestation. The corporate food industry also relies heavily on plastic packaging — another big source of emissions., ""They're invested in the system which generates greenhouse gas emissions, and essentially they are trapped by the need to continue to not only be profitable, but to grow their profits,"" says Ricardo Salvador with the Union of Concerned Scientists., This isn't the first regenerative agriculture commitment PepsiCo has made. Last year, the company, which earned $9.7 billion over the past year, committed to converting its entire 7 million acre agricultural footprint to regenerative practices by 2030. The company says that will eliminate at least 3 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the farmland in that footprint grows potatoes, whole corn, oats, and oranges, In its first year, PepsiCo inched only 5% of the way through that goal, enrolling 345,000 acres in its various regenerative agriculture programs., Still, Andrew is optimistic. While he won't reveal 2022 acreage yet, he calls it ""a decided step up."", The scale-up challenge, Currently, only 15% of global farmland is cared for using regenerative practices, according to the new action plan and report from the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI). The group says that number needs to scale up to 40% by 2030 in order to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as laid out in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. And that won't be easy, especially given the current global agriculture market., ""The commodity system tells [farmers]: Yield at all costs,"" says Sarah Carlson with Practical Farmers of Iowa. ""And yield at all costs means that Mother Nature then pays. Climate change is her telling us: No more."", Converting to regenerative agriculture is a financial risk for farmers. It can cost tens of thousands of dollars to buy new equipment and additional seed, fuel and labor. And in its current state, the commodity crop market doesn't provide incentives to incur that cost., ""We need to invest in those farmers to de-risk that transition,"" she says. ""I do think that companies have a huge role to play in making a big shift on the landscape."", That could manifest in a number of ways, but Carlson says one of the most effective would be to bake it into procurement contracts. In other words, the onus would be on the company to buy an ingredient (corn, rice, potatoes, etc.) only if it was grown using sustainable practices., ""That's absolutely an essential part of this plan,"" says Grant Reid, outgoing CEO of Mars and chair of the SMI taskforce., The plan, while lacking in specificity, lays out five general strategies to financially incentivize farmers to transition to regenerative agriculture. The strategies range from direct payments to farmers to encouraging governments around the world to commit policy and public money., Reid, former chief procurement officer for Mars, says another strategy is to change the way companies buy their products., ""We used to buy a spec against the quality and price,"" he says. ""Now I think we need to have our sustainability teams and our procurement teams working closely."", Reid acknowledges prescribing any one fix across twelve of the largest global food companies is unrealistic. What works for a fast food chain might not work for a beverage corporation. And, along the same lines, what works for a rice farmer in India might not work for a corn farmer in Iowa., ""There's no one size fits all, right?"" he says. ""There's not one crop, one company, one country that's identical. So you can't be too prescriptive."", But that lack of precision could make it difficult to track the coalition's climate progress. Especially because there's no standardized definition of regenerative agriculture. There's no step-by-step guide or menu dictating what constitutes a regenerative farm., ""We're satisfied so far when somebody tells us that they're using a regenerative practice, say, reduced tillage or cover crops, without then asking the question: How do you know that? What is the actual, quantifiable, verifiable result?"" says Salvador with the Union of Concerned Scientists., In other words, there's no standard for how much carbon is sequestered on one acre of cover crops, for instance. That number will vary by region, crop and farmer., ""In addition to being verifiable, it needs to be permanent,"" says Salvador. ""Because if it's not permanent, then in essence it's not really helping us with climate change."", Despite his cautionary notes, Salvador acknowledges the important role of private industry in scaling up regenerative agriculture across the food system., Ultimately, if the world wants more farmers to farm like Will Cannon, food companies need to send those market signals. While most of his farming neighbors still look at him and his untilled ground funny, Cannon thinks that could change if the private industry keeps putting their money where their mouth is., ""As farmers, we've got to offer a bountiful crop again in the future, and I'm hopeful for the seeds that a lot of these companies are trying to plant right now,"" says Cannon.",Climate

Jennifer Seifert/Pumpkins For Pigs hide caption, From October to December, Pumpkins For Pigs connects community members across the country with local farms, so their leftover pumpkins can be used for animal feed., The U.S. produces lots of pumpkins each year — more than 2 billion in 2020 alone. But that year, only one fifth were used for food, which means Americans are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the gourds annually, just to toss them in the trash when Halloween ends., So they end up in landfills, which were designed to store material — not allow them to break down. The lack of oxygen in landfills means organic matter like pumpkins produce methane gas, a greenhouse gas that's harmful for the climate., Videos about how to responsibly dispose of your jack-o'-lanterns have been making the rounds on TikTok. Marne Titchenell, a wildlife program specialist for Ohio State University Extension, has noticed the popularity of the topic, and even told NPR that her second grader was sent home with an article about composting pumpkins., You can compost it. Titchenell said this is a good way to recycle pumpkins and other unused fruits and vegetables back into soil, which can be used to grow new plants. In New York and other places, neighborhoods even meet up to smash pumpkins and then have them composted. If you don't have compost, see if a community garden will take your pumpkins., You can cook with it. Pumpkin is more nutrient-dense than you might think. A cup of cooked pumpkin contains more than 200% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin A, 20% of the recommended vitamin C and is a great source of potassium. Better Home and Gardens has recipes for toasted seeds and fresh pumpkin puree to be used instead of the canned stuff. This curried pumpkin soup from Epicurious was made for a 2015 NPR article., You can put it out for wildlife. Remove any wax, paint or marker from the pumpkin, and leave it outside for squirrels and birds. To go the extra mile, scoop birdseed into the bowl of the squash. Cutting the pumpkin into quarters makes it easier to eat for bigger mammals like deer., You can donate it. Some farms, zoos and animal shelters will accept pumpkins for animal feed. Pumpkins For Pigs matches people who want to donate their unaltered pumpkins with pigs (and other pumpkin-eating animals, the organization says on its site) in their region. The founder, Jennifer Seifert, started the project after years of guilt throwing away perfectly good pumpkins. She told NPR in an email that Pumpkins For Pigs' mission is to ""reduce food waste by diverting pumpkins, gourds and other food items to farms and animal sanctuaries for feed or compost."" She said that the process also brings communities together.",Environment

Flooding in Pakistan this summer that killed at least 1,500 people and a multi-year drought in East Africa are evidence of ""mounting and ever-increasing climate risks,"" the U.N. report says., To help developing nations prepare for more extreme storms, heat waves and floods, industrialized countries gave them around $29 billion in 2020. But that's a fraction of what the developing world needs in order to reduce the damage from extreme weather events, the report says. By the end of the decade, developing countries will likely need up to about 10 times more money every year to adapt to a hotter planet. By midcentury, those annual costs could soar to more than $500 billion., ""The message of this report is clear: strong political will is needed to increase adaptation investments and outcomes,"" Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme, wrote in a foreword to the report., ""If we don't want to spend the coming decades in emergency response mode, dealing with disaster after disaster, we need to get ahead of the game,"" she added., The U.N. published the report days before its annual climate conference starts in Egypt. In a separate report published last week, the U.N. said the world isn't cutting greenhouse gas emissions nearly enough to avoid potentially catastrophic sea level rise and other global dangers., The U.N. climate negotiations scheduled to begin over the weekend in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh are the 27th Conference of the Parties, or COP27.

Of the $83.3 billion developing countries received in 2020, most of the money went to mitigation projects, not adaptation, according to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development., ""The discourse needs to be raised significantly, the level of ambition, so that you can actually continue to do what you're doing on mitigation even more, but you at the same time meet the adaptation needs,"" says Mafalda Duarte, CEO of Climate Investment Funds, which works with development banks like the World Bank to provide funding to developing countries on favorable terms., To prepare for more extreme weather, the world needs to invest more money in projects to reduce the hazards, vulnerability and exposure that people face, the U.N. says. That could include building water reservoirs in areas at risk of drought, ensuring infrastructure is built to stand up to the impacts of a hotter climate, and providing communities with early warning systems to help people evacuate in emergencies., At the end of last year's U.N. climate conference, developed countries were urged to at least double their funding for adaptation from 2019 levels by 2025. However, the U.N. says even that amount of money would be insufficient to address the needs that exist in developing nations to prepare for climate risk., The U.N. also warned that issues unrelated to climate change, including worldwide inflation and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, could limit how much money wealthier countries are willing to provide developing nations for adaptation., Duarte says that failing to spend the money that's necessary to limit and prepare for climate change exposes the entire world to potential risks. Those risks could include armed conflicts, refugee crises and disruptions in financial markets, analysts say., ""We have to change our mindset and the way we think, because, actually, when it comes to climate, you know, an investment across borders in other places is a domestic investment,"" Duarte says.",Climate

Despite the rise in temperatures, there were enough surviving corals left behind to help reproduce and replenish the reefs., The second factor was the Kiribati government's decision to fully protect those waters., ""It has an abundance of fish that is off the charts.

Christopher Blank of member station WKNO in Memphis reports on the efforts to keep the river and its traffic flowing. Water depth on the Mississippi has been so important for so long that the author Samuel Clemens, a one-time riverboat pilot, took his pen name from a measurement - the Mark Twain. In his day, that meant the water was deep enough to boat on. Today, Captain Adrian Pirani could probably write his own book about the Mississippi and its ebbs and flows. The river was completely closed here for a few days. Pirani, who runs the Army Corps of Engineers ship called the Dredge Hurley, arrived in this section of the river north of Memphis early last week to get it back open. Water levels here recently dipped below a record set in 1988. This is the worst I've ever seen. With his long hair and cowboy boots, Pirani oversees the dredge as it sucks up debris and sand from the riverbed to make the shipping lane deeper. In the past month, it's traveled some 900 miles from New Orleans to Cairo, Ill., and is now headed back south in an around-the-clock effort to keep the lower Mississippi open for business.For Mike Clay, a hydrologist with the Corps of Engineers, even the science is trying to keep up. He says measuring water this low is more difficult these days, as he stands at the end of a boat ramp that now drops off onto a pile of rocks. The gauges that have been installed for decades were not built to measure water this low. The past decade has been one of extremes on the Mississippi. Historic high and low depths have come almost back to back, a pattern intensified by the warming climate. This year's drought in the heartland, Clay says, resembles a dry weather cycle last seen in 2000. The water levels remained low all the way into January, and that could happen again. At the moment, there's not a significant amount of rain out on the horizon. Which means agencies that manage river traffic will likely stay busy for the foreseeable future. We're all hands on deck. This is 24/7 work that we're doing, and we're throwing all the assets that we have and people at it. That is Lieutenant Phillip VanderWeit with the U.S. Coast Guard. The agency is in charge of moving the buoys that mark safe lanes for boats to travel. The river conditions are changing every day, you know? So it takes an active approach to stay ahead of that. And it's critical since half of America's grain export flows down the river. Randy Chamness with the Lower Mississippi Committee, an association of shipping groups, says storage has run out for farmers waiting to get the fall harvest onto barges. And although we are moving it, we're moving it in much less quantities. So it just keeps backing up and backing up. Yet some scenes along Old Man River remain the same. In Memphis, Captain Scott Musgrove is in the wheelhouse of a sightseeing boat. Harbor dredging has kept the company afloat. As we head downriver, he points out curiosity seekers on the newly exposed riverbed, exploring some twisted metal. I think that's part of an old steamboat right there. All up and down the river, the low water has revealed the skeletons of sunken ships and artifacts that date back more than a century. This is the time to explore with a metal detector and all. That's where you need to be right now. But on the main deck, tourists have lost interest in the riverbed and drift back to the bar and dance floor. And the music is appropriate.(, """") (Singing) Rolling on the river.

Isabel Infantes/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, Phoebe Plummer, pictured at a demonstration in London's Piccadilly Circus in early October, spoke to Morning Edition about the tactics Just Stop Oil is using to draw attention to the urgency of climate change., Phoebe Plummer has recently gone viral, but they're not interested in being popular. They're more focused on helping stop climate change., Plummer was one of two climate activists with the group Just Stop Oil who raised eyebrows worldwide after they threw tomato soup at Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers at London's National Gallery of Art in mid-October. It's one of the many public actions the group has taken in recent weeks alone, including blocking streets, spray-painting buildings orange and smashing a King Charles III wax figure with chocolate cake., While the painting itself was covered by glass and unharmed, critics have questioned this method of protest. Even so, more people around the world are staging similar demonstrations to draw attention to the climate change crisis — and, in the case of Just Stop Oil, calls for their governments to stop new fossil fuel licensing and production., Plummer, a 21-year-old university student who uses they/them pronouns, says they're looking to create a cleaner, better future for future generations., ""I'm doing this so that one day I can look at my niece or nephew in the eye and say, 'I fought for your future,'"" Plummer explains., Plummer spoke with Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep about why the group chose these tactics and what they hope will happen next., This conversation has been edited for length and clarity., On why they joined Just Stop Oil and what the organization does, I joined back in August, largely out of a sense of fear and despairing. I tried all the more traditional forms of activism, I guess you could say. I've written to [lawmakers], I've signed petitions, I've gone on marches. I did all the things I felt I could do for the climate and eventually went vegan, stopped buying clothes firsthand. And I was so frustrated that I saw it not going anywhere. I saw it not making any meaningful change. So I saw what Just Stop Oil was doing, and for the first time I felt a bit of hope that I could do something to secure myself a future., Just Stop Oil started going out into action in April. And all through April, we went to the heart of the fossil fuel industry. We climbed up on tankers to stop them moving. We formed blocks in front of oil depots, so none of the tankers could come and leave. We had incredibly brave people dig tunnels under oil terminals, so the roads had to be closed off, and staying in these tunnels for weeks sometimes. We went to petrol stations and smashed up petrol pumps and destroyed the machines that are destroying us., Digging a tunnel under the road, so the person is essentially saying, ""If you want to drive on this necessary road, you're going to have to kill me?"", Yeah, it risks the driver's life, the tunneler's life., When did the group begin targeting museums and paintings?, Since October, we have been engaging in disruptive acts all around London because right now what is missing to make this change is political will. So our action in particular was a media-grabbing action to get people talking, not just about what we did, but why we did it., And what did you do?, Me and my amazing friend Anna threw soup on the Vincent van Gogh sunflower painting., The two of you glued your hands to the wall. What did that feel like?, Well, I've glued quite a few times, and people always ask me, ""Doesn't it hurt? Isn't it uncomfortable?"" It really isn't. I mean, the police have this solvent that they use, which just de-bonds you from the wall. It's not painful at all., It seems like it'd be annoying, until they get you off, to be stuck on the wall., Yeah. Admittedly, we didn't choose the most comfy positions [laughs]., Why tomato soup?, One, to grab people's attention — it hasn't been done before, and it was something new. But almost more importantly, to draw attention to the cost of living crisis. In the U.K., we are facing a horrendous cost of living crisis and it is part of the cost of oil crisis., How did you choose that particular painting?, Because of its notoriety. And it's a beautiful work of art and I think a lot of people, when they saw us, had feelings of shock or horror or outrage because they saw something beautiful and valuable and they thought it was being damaged or destroyed. But, you know, where is that emotional response when it's our planet and our people that are being destroyed., Just Stop Oil protesters block the roads at a major intersection on Thursday in London, England, the latest in its series of public demonstrations. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images hide caption, Just Stop Oil protesters block the roads at a major intersection on Thursday in London, England, the latest in its series of public demonstrations., What does Just Stop Oil want?, So our demand is that the government immediately halts all new fossil fuel licenses. In the U.K., we have eight years worth of oil in reserves, so those eight years need to be used to make a just and fair transition to a renewable future. And that transition needs to include training for people who work in the fossil fuel industry currently. There's a lot of transferable skills so that they have job security in a renewable future. It needs to include the insulation of British homes and it needs to include subsidized public transport., You understand, if you were to stop oil in a way that raised energy prices dramatically, it would harm the same low-income people that you want to help?, Oh yeah ... and that's the last thing we want. Nobody should be left behind in a renewable future. But renewables are nine times cheaper. The largest solar farm in the U.K. was built in just six weeks, whereas these new oil licenses that the government are proposing — it takes 15 to 25 years for any oil to even come out of the ground from these., It seems you would need to build not just a momentary political majority, but a long-term political majority in favor of change., Yes, this is why Just Stop Oil uses these tactics of civil resistance, because history has shown us that civil resistance works. I'm sitting here today as a queer person. And the reason I'm able to vote, I'm able to go to university, hopefully someday marry the person I love is because of people who have taken part in acts of civil resistance before me., How do you respond to people who may agree with your policies, but say that with with Russia's war in Ukraine and energy prices, we need to make compromises?, The fact is we don't have any time to waste. Last year, the former chief scientific adviser for the U.K., Sir David King, said that what we do in the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity ... When are we going to start listening to the scientists? When are we going to wake up and realize that if we don't act now, we are going to see catastrophic outcomes?, The audio for this interview was edited by HJ Mai.

Victims of a huge mudslide set off by Tropical Storm Nalgae in a coastal Philippine village that had once been devastated by a killer tsunami mistakenly thought a tidal wave was coming and ran to higher ground toward a mountain and were buried alive, an official said Sunday., MANILA, Philippines — More than 100 people have died in one of the most destructive storms to lash the Philippines this year with dozens more feared missing after villagers fled in the wrong direction and got buried in a boulder-laden mudslide. Almost two million others were swamped by floods in several provinces, officials said Monday., At least 53 of 105 people who died — mostly in flash floods and landslides — were from Maguindanao province in a Muslim autonomous region, which was swamped by unusually heavy rains set off by Tropical Storm Nalgae. The storm blew out into the South China Sea on Sunday, leaving a trail of destruction in a large swath of the archipelago., A large contingent of rescuers with bulldozers, backhoes and sniffer dogs resumed retrieval work in southern Kusiong village in hard-hit Maguindanao, where as many as 80 to 100 people, including entire families, are feared to have been buried by a boulder-laden mudslide or swept away by flash floods that started overnight Thursday, said Naguib Sinarimbo, the interior minister for the Bangsamoro autonomous region run by former separatist guerrillas under a peace pact., The government's main disaster-response agency said there were at least 98 storm deaths, and seven other fatalities were later reported by three provincial governors. At least 69 people were injured and 63 others remain missing., Rescuers carry a body at Maguindanao's Datu Odin Sinsuat town, southern Philippines on Sunday. AP hide caption, Rescuers carry a body at Maguindanao's Datu Odin Sinsuat town, southern Philippines on Sunday., About 1.9 million people were lashed by the storm, including more than 975,000 villagers who fled to evacuation centers or homes of relatives. At least 4,100 houses and 16,260 hectares (40,180 acres) of rice and other crops were damaged by floodwaters at a time when the country was bracing for a looming food crisis because of global supply disruptions, officials said., Sinarimbo said the official tally of missing people did not include most of those feared missing in the huge mudslide that hit Kusiong because entire families may have been buried and no member was left to provide names and details to authorities., The catastrophe in Kusiong, populated mostly by the Teduray ethnic minority group, was particularly tragic because its more than 2,000 villagers have carried out disaster-preparedness drills every year for decades to brace for a tsunami because of a deadly history. But they were not as prepared for the dangers that could come from Mount Minandar, where their village lies at the foothills, Sinarimbo said., ""When the people heard the warning bells, they ran up and gathered in a church on a high ground,"" Sinarimbo told The Associated Press on Saturday, citing accounts by Kusiong villagers., ""The problem was, it was not a tsunami that inundated them but a big volume of water and mud that came down from the mountain,"" he said., In August 1976, an 8.1-magnitude earthquake and a tsunami in the Moro Gulf that struck around midnight left thousands of people dead and devastated coastal provinces in one of the deadliest natural disasters in Philippine history., Lying between the Moro Gulf and 446-meter (1,464-foot) Mount Minandar, Kusiong was among the hardest hit by the 1976 catastrophe. The village never forgot the tragedy. Elderly villagers who survived the tsunami and powerful earthquake passed on the nightmarish story to their children, warning them to be prepared., Residents walk beside remains of damaged homes at Maguindanao's Datu Odin Sinsuat town. AP hide caption, Residents walk beside remains of damaged homes at Maguindanao's Datu Odin Sinsuat town., ""Every year, they hold drills to brace for a tsunami. Somebody was assigned to bang the alarm bells and they designated high grounds where people should run to,"" Sinarimbo said. ""Villagers were even taught the sound of an approaching big wave based on the recollection of the tsunami survivors."", ""But there wasn't as much focus on the geo-hazards on the mountainside,"" he said., There were more than 100 rescuers from the army, police and volunteers from other provinces Saturday in Kusiong, but they were unable to dig at a spot where survivors said the church lay underneath because the muddy mound was still dangerously soft, officials said., A coast guard video provided to media on Monday showed some of its men helping search for buried bodies in Kusiong by poking long wooden sticks into the muddy, light-brown sludge., The stormy weather in a large swath of the country hindered transportation as millions of Filipinos planned to travel over a long weekend for visits to relatives' tombs and for family reunions on All Saints' Day in the largely Roman Catholic nation., Nearly 200 domestic and international flights were canceled, Manila's international airport was briefly closed amid stormy weather and voyages in storm-whipped seas were prohibited by the coast guard, stranding thousands of passengers., Floodwaters swamped many provinces and cities, trapping some people on their roofs. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. inspected the extent of damage aboard a helicopter over Cavite province Monday and later handed boxes of food and other supplies to storm victims in Noveleta town, where some residents were trapped on their roofs at the height of flooding over the weekend., ""The powerful surge of water destroyed the flood controls so there was so much flooding,"" he told a news conference., About 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippine archipelago each year.

The sticker says ""I did that"" — but the president wasn't responsible for rising prices then or falling prices now. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, A gas pump displays current fuel prices, along with a sticker of President Biden, at a gas station in Arlington, Va., on March 16. The sticker says ""I did that"" — but the president wasn't responsible for rising prices then or falling prices now., Prices at the pump are falling, which is welcome news for Democrats this election season., And a few weeks ago prices were rising, which was bad news for Democrats., But no matter which way prices are going — and which way they go next — the cost of fuel simply doesn't have much to do with who is in office., The government does have some limited levers to try to adjust prices. President Joe Biden's announcement of a massive release of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve earlier this year did move markets — temporarily., But overwhelmingly, prices are set by the laws of supply and demand. Here's what you need to know., Two main forces are sending prices down., One is an improving refinery situation. Last month, outages at refineries, particularly in the West and the Great Lakes area, sent prices in some regions skyrocketing., ""We were seeing, every day, gas prices increase by 10, 15, sometimes 20 cents a gallon,"" remembered Anlleyn Venegas, a San Diego-based AAA spokeswoman., Now refineries are coming back online and the supply of gasoline is going up which, in turn, is pushing prices down., Meanwhile, autumn has arrived. That means, like clockwork, pumpkin spice has taken over the grocery aisle, colorful leaves have taken over Instagram — and demand for gasoline has started to decrease. Americans drive less when it's colder, and gas prices almost always go down this time of year., Add those together, and you get prices dropping every day since Oct. 11., That announcement was more of an update about the big release announced this spring; no new barrels of oil were involved., ""It wasn't a new announcement,"" says Patrick De Haan, of the price tracking app Gasbuddy. ""The market had been expecting that ... it's really not moving the needle much."", The White House has certainly been trying to move prices down. In addition to that update on the SPR release, it also pledged to refill the strategic reserves if prices fall, an attempt to incentivize domestic oil producers to pump more oil by giving them a guaranteed buyer., Earlier, it attempted to practice oil diplomacy and coax Saudi Arabia into boosting production. But the Saudis and their allies did the opposite with a major production cut earlier this month., The Biden administration also excoriated oil companies for not keeping enough oil in inventory, and threatened export bans. (The industry warns such bans would backfire badly.), None of those efforts can really be credited for today's falling prices., This is a longstanding frustration for whoever is in the White House; while politicians are held responsible for gasoline prices, they have very limited tools for actually affecting those prices, and the tools they do have don't work super well., The White House says we need more oil in the short term, to meet energy needs, but less oil in the long term, to reduce the catastrophic impacts of climate change. Oil executives do not like that message, and say it makes it harder to plan investments., However, as the White House takes pains to note, current federal policy is not blocking production. There's no drilling ban in place., So why is U.S. production lower than it might be? There's a tug-of-war going on, between incentives to drill more oil and incentives to drill less. On the ""more oil"" side you have the profit a company can make on each new barrel it drills. On the ""less oil"" side, you have supply chain problems, labor shortages, investors who are enjoying high oil prices, and fears of a global recession, as well as the potential impact of long-term climate policies., Some governments around the world simply own oil production within their borders outright and set fuel prices for their citizens regardless of market prices. Think of Venezuela, or Iran. The U.S. economy is, intentionally, set up very differently., However, in Europe — in many countries with economies much more like the U.S. — governments are currently discussing some fairly unprecedented interventions into energy markets. The war in Ukraine has sent natural gas prices haywire. Politicians are deeply concerned about the availability and cost of heating, electricity and fuel. And they're looking at windfall taxes to claw back profits from energy companies, and rebates and price caps to cut costs for consumers. These proposals are attempts to more directly influence the prices consumers pay for energy in Europe., It's far too soon to say whether those interventions will work out. Right now, though, similar proposals have not gained traction in Washington, D.C.",Energy

For a lot of us, our closest connection to nature happens at our local park. As the Earth warms, city parks will become more and more important as climate oases.This past summer, Rebecca Hersher and Ryan Kellman of NPR's Climate Desk teamed up with NPR's Short Wave podcast to bring us this day in the life of one city park. Short Wave producer Margaret Cirino takes it from here. #1: How are you doing? I'm good. How are you? #1: Oh, I thought you wanted my autograph. So a few weeks ago, I spent the day in Philadelphia - like, literally one day. That was the assignment - spend 24 hours in Fairmount Park and record everything that happens.I'm standing outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art on those steps where ""Rocky"" was filmed - that iconic scene - except I haven't seen the movie. And it's really, really hot out. It's so hot. I'm sweating.To be clear, this was not my idea. Yeah, I'm sorry. It was my idea, sort of - mine and Rebecca's. Yeah. We were trying to capture something that's really big. It's hard to capture - what climate change feels like. Yeah, this all started with a pretty simple idea. You know, most people in the U.S. live in cities. Actually, at least 80% of the U.S. population lives in urban areas. Which means city parks are one of the places where most Americans actually feel climate change happening. So we wanted to really zoom all the way in on one city park. And we chose Fairmount Park in Philadelphia. It's gigantic - one of the biggest city parks in the U.S. And we visited on a really, really hot day in August. #2: You got it... #3: And it's hairy. #4: Hi, puppy. #5: And so you have... #6: I got chicken liver. I got worms. #1: That's an egg. #7: (Inaudible), you got to come on. #8: I'm here. I see you. #9: Oh, no. What do you guys get out of coming to this space in this city? #10: That's a tough one. #11: (Laughter). #10: Give me a minute. It's free. It's, like, you could do whatever you want. #12: Well, I guess if you want a one-word answer, just, like, pleasure. I mean, yeah, it's nice out, dude. So I am Zemela (ph). I'm the owner of Zem Soul. So I'm just selling food. I got some fish, sticky wings, jerk. Real good - it's real good. #2: Five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four... #3: Excuse me. You think you could jump up there and get my ball?(. , """") So by this time, it's about 7 p.m. and still pretty hot out. We wanted to go to a more tree-y place... Tree-y. ...Because green spaces - tree-filled places - are a lot cooler than spaces that have a lot of pavement and buildings. It can be five, even 10 degrees cooler in some cases, which is a huge difference. And climate scientists and urban planners will tell you that's one reason that everyone who lives in a city should really have access to green space, especially as heatwaves get more common with climate change. So we went to a bit of a more lush part of the park between a river and a busy road just to see who was out. Well, my name is Jelani (ph). Right now, we are looking at the water. We are on the edge of the Schuylkill River. It's like a getaway out of the city, even with all the hustle and bustle of gentrification - school, crime, bills (laughter). Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about when you look out at this river? I think about my family. I think about peace. I think about the light at the end of the tunnel. #13: Look out, look out. Here, right side. Hey, bro. Hey, bro. #14: You know, I think I checked it out. OK. So by now, the sun had gone down. The streetlights were on. Yeah. And I was deep in the park at this point. There wasn't really anyone around, and I found some grass, and I just lay down.That's a fox.In the 24 hours that we were in Fairmount Park, I saw two foxes, actually; a bunch of cottontail rabbits; a Cooper's Hawk; multiple types of ducks. It felt like a wild place, not just a human place.So take a moment. Listen to these animals communicating with each other, calling out for mates, marking territory. This is the sound of nature in the city. OK, so we didn't actually sleep in the park. We left for a few hours - maybe 1:30 to 4:30. Yeah, not very long to sleep. But one thing I noticed was that in those few short hours, the animal sounds in the park changed dramatically. For one thing, the speed of the cricket's call increases when it's warmer, and we arrived back in the park right at sunrise, when it was warming up.(Yawning) I'm really tired. So by mid-morning, the park was, like, filling up with people doing Saturday stuff. There was a softball team practicing for something called the Gay World Series. Yeah. And right near where they were practicing, the guys from the local social lodge were setting up for a huge cookout.Oh, that sounds good. #15: I know. I bet it does. Studies actually show that being outside can help relieve feelings of sadness, stress and isolation. #16: Just breathe in the air. The air, the sun. #16: Yeah. The dirt. #16: Yeah. You know? #17: Especially for the last two years for me in particular because I've been working from home since the pandemic. So it's nice to be able to get outside and actually see people rather than just see them on Zoom or hear them over the phone. #18: Ooh, great hit. #19: Well, we're lucky because we live out here. You see that tunnel right there? We live on the right side in a tent. Oh. How is that for you? #20: It's great. #19: It's great because we're under the bridge, so we're, like, protected from water, and it's cool. And then we have occasional - well, you see, we have... #20: Visitors. #19: Sometimes we come home and we find people smoking meth in our area. #20: They're getting high. #19: Yeah, sometimes we find that. But mostly, we've not really been robbed. For the most part, nobody really bothers us. And for the most part... OK, and with that, we have not fully finished our journey. Yes. So it is time to return to where we began. It's going on noon, and we need to go to the Museum of Art - the steps at the southern end of the park where Margaret started her journey on Friday. Yeah, yeah, otherwise known as the ""Rocky"" Steps. Ryan, are we going to run up these steps? I mean, we're here. Feels like somebody has to run up the steps. You said somebody, not yourself. It is very hot. All these people have Italian ice, and I don't. I'll run up the steps with you. OK. OK. Ready, set, go.(, """") This is producer Margaret Cirino back at high noon once again.

David Goldman/AP hide caption, A cow walks through a field as an oil pumpjack and a flare burning off methane and other hydrocarbons stand in the background in the Permian Basin in Jal, N.M., Oct. 14, 2021., GENEVA — The three main greenhouse gases hit record high levels in the atmosphere last year, the U.N. weather agency said Wednesday, calling it an ""ominous"" sign as war in Ukraine, rising costs of food and fuel, and other worries have elbowed in on longtime concerns about global warming in recent months., ""More bad news for the planet,"" the World Meteorological Organization said in a statement along with its latest annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin. It's one of several reports released in recent days looking at several aspects of humanity's struggle with climate change in the run up to the U.N.'s latest climate conference, in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt., Of the three main types of heat-trapping greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — the biggest jump from 2020 to 2021 was in methane, whose concentrations in the air came in with the biggest year-on-year increase since regular measurements began four decades ago, WMO said., ""The continuing rise in concentrations of the main heat-trapping gases, including the record acceleration in methane levels, shows that we are heading in the wrong direction,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas., Methane is more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, but doesn't stay in the atmosphere nearly as long as carbon dioxide and there's 200 times more carbon dioxide in the air than methane. Over a 20-year time-period, a molecule of methane traps about 81 times the heat as a molecule of carbon dioxide but over a century it goes down to trapping 28 times more heat per molecule than carbon dioxide, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change., Since pre-industrial times, which WMO sets at around the year 1750, CO2 concentrations in the air have increased by nearly 50% to 415.7 parts per million, with the U.S., China and Europe responsible for the bulk of emissions. Methane is up 162% to 1,908 parts per billion, and nitrous oxide — whose human-made sources are things like biomass burning, industrial processes and fertilizer use — is up about one-quarter to 334.5 parts per million., Earlier on Wednesday the U.N's climate office said current pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions put the planet on course to blow past the limit for global warming countries agreed to in the 2015 Paris climate accord., It said its latest estimate based on 193 national emissions targets would see temperatures rise to 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial averages by the end of the century, a full degree higher than the ambitious goal set in the Paris pact to limit warming by 1.5 C (2.7 F)., ""We are still nowhere near the scale and pace of emission reductions required to put us on track toward a 1.5 degrees Celsius world,"" the head of the U.N. climate office, Simon Stiell, said in a statement. ""To keep this goal alive, national governments need to strengthen their climate action plans now and implement them in the next eight years."", The report found that emissions will also increase by 10.6% by 2030 from 2010 levels, a slight decrease from the 13.7% estimates last year., A report published Wednesday by Climate Action Tracker who track nations' pledges to reduce warming found that of 40 indicators for reducing emissions — like weaning off coal, ramping up electric vehicles or reducing deforestation — the world wasn't on track for any of them to match the levels of emissions reductions scientists say are needed to limit warming to 1.5C. Over half of the indicators showed the world is ""well off track"" to cutting emissions but added that promising progress has been made., Climatologists and environmental advocates have been raising their voices for years about the impact of climate change, by pointing to vast changes in the weather in recent decades like forest fires in China and western United States, drought in the horn of Africa and unprecedented flooding in Pakistan – to name only a few., CO2 remains the single most important greenhouse gas generated by human activity — mainly from burning of fossil fuels and cement production — amounting to about two-thirds of the warming effect on the climate, known as radiative forcing. Over the last decade, carbon dioxide has been responsible for about four-fifths of that warming effect., Methane accounts for about more than one-sixth of the warming effect, said WMO. Three-fifths of methane reaches the atmosphere through the burps and farts of livestock, rice farming, use of fossil fuels, biomass burning and landfills; the rest comes from natural sources like wetlands and termites., Rob Jackson, who heads the Global Carbon Project, suggested that the spikes in methane over the last two years were ""mysterious"" — either blips related to the coronavirus pandemic, which temporary dented emissions, or a sign of ""a dangerous acceleration in methane emissions from wetlands and other systems we've been worrying about for decades."", ""Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide are not just rising, they're rising faster than ever. While not losing our focus on carbon dioxide, we need to pay more attention to the 'other' greenhouse gases,"" he added. ""Fortunately, methane is beginning to get the attention it deserves"" through initiatives like the Global Methane Pledge, a capping effort supported by the U.S. and European Union, among others., Nitrous oxide remains ""mostly ignored,"" he added., Taalas, who has been repeating warnings about global warming for years, says the focus should remain on CO2., ""As the top and most urgent priority, we have to slash carbon dioxide emissions which are the main driver of climate change and associated extreme weather, and which will affect climate for thousands of years through polar ice loss, ocean warming and sea level rise,"" he said., NASA announced that an instrument on the International Space Station designed to look at mineral dust turned out to be a useful tool to find ""super emitters"" of methane from orbit. NASA shared three images showing plumes several miles long that are spewing methane., A group of a dozen leaks from pipeline and other gas infrastructure in Turkmenistan is leaking 55 tons of methane per hour, about the same as the infamous 2015 Aliso Canyon leak, drilling in New Mexico that's spewing 18 tons per hour and a landfill in Iran that's emitting 8 tons per hour., ""We're looking in places where no one is planning to look for methane,"" said NASA instrument scientist Robert Green. ""If it's there we'll see it.""",Climate

""Climate change is having a profound impact on species around the world and addressing it is a priority for the Administration. The listing of the emperor penguin serves as an alarm bell but also a call to action."", There are as many as 650,000 emperor penguins now in Antarctica. That could shrink by 26% to 47% by 2050, according to estimates cited by wildlife officials. A study last year predicted that, under current trends, nearly all emperor penguin colonies would become ""quasi-extinct"" by 2100., The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the penguins as ""near threatened"" on its Red List of Threatened Species., Emperor penguins could lose half of their population by 2050. Christopher Michel/Flickr Creative Commons hide caption, As sea ice disappears because of climate change, the penguins lose needed space to breed and raise chicks and to avoid predators. Their key food source, krill, is also declining because of melting ice, ocean acidification and industrial fishing, according to the Center for Biological Diversity., The organization first petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make the endangered species designation for emperor penguins in 2011. The center's climate science director, Shaye Wolf, said the decision ""is a warning that emperor penguins need urgent climate action if they're going to survive. The penguin's very existence depends on whether our government takes strong action now to cut climate-heating fossil fuels and prevent irreversible damage to life on Earth."", Though emperor penguins are not found naturally in the U.S., the endangered species protections will help increase funding for conservation efforts.

Rake excess amounts into a landscape bed. Kris Lord/Flickr Creative Commons hide caption, It's best to chop up leaves, which will then break down in the grass. Rake excess amounts into a landscape bed., As leaves across America make their annual autumn pilgrimage from the treetops to the ground, lawn and wildlife experts say it's better to leave them around than to bag them., First, because it keeps leaves out of landfills. Every year, about 8 million tons of leaves end up there., And second, because leaves help the grass., Leaves are full of nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium., ""Those nutrients are being returned to the soil,"" Susan Barton, a professor and extension specialist in landscape horticulture at the University of Delaware, told NPR. ""But probably even more important than that, it's the organic matter. It's the fact that you've got this tissue that then eventually decomposes and improves the soil health."", They also provide a habitat for insects, spiders, slugs — and depending on where you live — possibly turtles, toads and small mammals, according to the University of Delaware's College of Agriculture & Natural Resources., In order to optimize your fallen leaves, some maintenance is recommended. It's best to run over a thin layer of leaves with a lawn mover or cut them up via other means so that they will break down more quickly. Thick layers of leaves are actually bad for the grass as well., ""If you just leave the leaves on the grass, it will exclude light. And then the grass won't be able to photosynthesize. Eventually, it would die under a thick layer of leaves,"" Barton said., Rake excess leaves into a landscape bed and it will turn into mulch. Shredded leaves can also be piled into a garden., ""Ideally, you want to let them decompose a little bit and they'll form a very nice mulch. Instead of going out and buying hardwood bark mulch, which is expensive, you can have a better mulch that's free,"" she said., At the same time, city dwellers should be mindful that wind and rain can push leaves into streets and clog up drainage systems — creating a flooding hazard., Some cities actually collect leaves for composting at a central facility, where it turns to mulch that residents can collect for free. On the other hand, leaves in landfills that don't have enough oxygen to decompose will end up releasing a significant amount of methane., How people deal with leaves is just one part of a longer-term issue of environmental sustainability., ""We want to think about those leaves as being a resource,"" and not a problem, Barton said. ""And when you think about sustainable landscaping, well, one of the things we say about sustainable landscaping is let natural processes happen. And that's a natural process.""",Environment

Laura Sullivan/NPR hide caption, Unwanted used plastic sits outside Garten Services, a recycling facility in Oregon., The vast majority of plastic that people use, and in many cases put into blue recycling bins, is headed to landfills, or worse, according to a report from Greenpeace on the state of plastic recycling in the U.S., The report cites separate data published this May which revealed that the amount of plastic actually turned into new things has fallen to new lows of around 5%. That number is expected to drop further as more plastic is produced., Greenpeace found that no plastic — not even soda bottles, one of the most prolific items thrown into recycling bins — meets the threshold to be called ""recyclable"" according to standards set by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation New Plastic Economy Initiative. Plastic must have a recycling rate of 30% to reach that standard; no plastic has ever been recycled and reused close to that rate., ""More plastic is being produced, and an even smaller percentage of it is being recycled,"" says Lisa Ramsden, senior plastic campaigner for Greenpeace USA. ""The crisis just gets worse and worse, and without drastic change will continue to worsen as the industry plans to triple plastic production by 2050."", Waste management experts say the problem with plastic is that it is expensive to collect and sort. There are now thousands of different types of plastic, and none of them can be melted down together. Plastic also degrades after one or two uses. Greenpeace found the more plastic is reused the more toxic it becomes., New plastic, on the other hand, is cheap and easy to produce. The result is that plastic trash has few markets — a reality the public has not wanted to hear., Trent Carpenter, the general manager of Southern Oregon Sanitation, says when they told customers a couple years ago that they could no longer take any plastic trash other than soda bottles and jugs — like milk containers and detergent bottles — people were upset. They wanted to put their strawberry containers, bags, yogurt cups and all manner of plastic trash in their recycling bin., ""We had to re-educate individuals that a great deal of that material is ending up in a landfill,"" Carpenter said. ""It's not going to a recycling facility and being recycled. It's going to a recycling facility and being landfilled someplace else because [you] can't do anything with that material."", That message has been difficult for the public to absorb with so many different bins in public spaces, and their own communities telling them to put their plastic in recycling containers., Carpenter says they wanted to be transparent with their customers and tell them the truth, unlike companies that continue to tell customers that plastic, such as bags and containers, is being turned into new things., ""Politically it's easier to just say 'Gosh, we're going to take everything and we think we can get it recycled,' and then look the other way,"" Carpenter said of the other companies. ""That's greenwashing at its best."", Greenpeace found a couple facilities are trying to reprocess cups and containers — sometimes called ""number 5s"" because of the markings on the containers. But the numbers are low. While 52% of recycling facilities in the U.S. accept that kind of plastic, the report found less than 5% of it is actually repurposed — and the rest is put into a landfill., Similarly, the National Association for PET Container Resources, an industry trade group, found in 2017 that only 21 percent of the plastic bottles collected for recycling were turned into new things., The low reprocessing rates are at odds with plans from the oil and gas industry. Industry lobbyists say they plan to recycle every piece of plastic they make into something new by 2040. In interviews with NPR, industry officials were unable to explain how they planned to reach a 100 percent recycling rate., An NPR investigative report found in 2020 that industry officials misled the public about the recyclability of plastic even though their own reports showed they knew as early as the 1970s and 1980s that plastic could not be economically recycled., The American Chemistry Council, an industry lobby group, initially did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the Greenpeace report. After publication, Joshua Baca, vice president of plastics for the group, sent an email to NPR calling Greenpeace's views ""misleading, out of touch and misguided."", He said the industry believes it is ""on the cusp of a circularity revolution"" when it comes to recycling plastic by ""scaling up sortation, advanced recycling, and new partnerships that enable used plastic to be remade again and again."", Environmentalists and lawmakers in some states are now pushing for legislation that bans single use plastics, and for ""bottle bills"" which pay customers to bring back their plastic bottles. The bills have led to successful recycling rates for plastic bottles in places like Oregon and Michigan, but have faced steep resistance from plastic and oil industry lobbyists., ""The real solution is to switch to systems of reuse and refill,"" Ramsden said. ""We are at a decision point on plastic pollution. It is time for corporations to turn off the plastic tap."", After years of embracing plastic recycling, many environmental groups say they hope the public will finally see plastic for what they say it is — trash — and that people will ask themselves if there is something else they could be using instead.",Investigations

Noah Berger/AP hide caption, Western wildfires burning in 2018, like the River Fire in Lakeport, Calif., sent plumes of smoke to the Central U.S. where it helped seed more destructive thunderstorms., In late July of 2018, massive wildfires blazed across Northern California. At the same time in Colorado, weather alerts went out warning of heavy thunderstorms and baseball-sized hail., The two disasters were separated by a thousand miles, but scientists are now finding they're connected., The massive clouds of smoke and heat that rise out of Western wildfires are having far-reaching effects across the country, even beyond hazy skies. That summer, the smoke blew to the Central U.S., where it ran headlong into summertime thunderstorms that were already forming., The collision made those storms even more extreme, boosting the rainfall and hail by more than 30 percent, according to a new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences., ""It's surprising to many people, probably,"" says Jiwen Fan, Laboratory Fellow at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and an author of the study. ""I really wanted to look at if there's any connections between them."", Understanding the effects of wildfires on weather patterns far downstream could help improve forecasts in those areas. In the Central U.S., extreme summer storms can pose a dangerous threat, often doing millions of dollars in damage., ""Scientists are showing that things are really connected to each other,"" says Danielle Touma, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who was not involved in the study. ""And we can't just think about where we live, but we have to think about what's happening in other parts of the world."", While it may seem like raindrops simply pour out of clouds, those drops won't form without a seed to get them started. Raindrops need microscopic particles, known as aerosols, which can be dust, soot, or even microbes, floating in the air., ""Lots of people do not realize, before rain, you have to have the tiny particles,"" Fan says. ""They're tiny particles you cannot see with the bare eye."", Hail from Central U.S. summer thunderstorms can pose a serious danger and cause millions of dollars in damage. Sean Waugh/NOAA/NSSL, hide caption, Hail from Central U.S. summer thunderstorms can pose a serious danger and cause millions of dollars in damage., The particles give water something to condense onto, eventually getting heavy enough to fall to the ground. In 2018, as the Carr Fire and Mendocino Complex burned in California, massive amounts of particles floated east across the Rockies, where they collided with large thunderstorms., More particles created the conditions for more raindrops, as well as hail, which occurs when powerful storms lift particles high into the cloud and water freezes on them. Running complex computer models, Fan and colleagues found that the Western wildfires boosted heavy rainfall in the storms by 34 percent and large hail by 38 percent., The heat released from wildfires also played a major role, since it can strengthen the winds that blow to the Central U.S.. Those winds picked up extra moisture on the way, providing more fuel for the thunderstorms and strengthening the intense dynamics inside the storms themselves. In the July 2018 storms, the winds in Colorado topped 100 miles per hour., ""These kinds of things can cause hail damage or flooding, depending on where the precipitation is falling,"" Sonia M. Kreidenweis, professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University. ""If the Central U.S. wasn't already set up to have a storm, it might not have the same kind of impact."", Historically, the West's fall fire season didn't overlap much with the summer thunderstorm season in Central U.S. states. But with climate change creating drier, hotter conditions for wildfires, that overlap could become more common, since destructive wildfires are happening earlier in the year., Understanding this long-range influence of wildfires could help improve weather forecasts, giving communities in the Central U.S. more accurate warnings when destructive hail and rain are on the way., ""If they know that California or Oregon are having an above average wildfire season, they might want to be on the lookout for more severe storms coming their way,"" Touma says.",Climate

Kristyna Wentz-Graff/OPB hide caption, From left: Republican candidate Christine Drazan, Democrat-turned-independent candidate Betsy Johnson and Democratic candidate Tina Kotek are all vying for the Oregon governor's office., No state in the country elects Democratic governors more reliably than Oregon, but every streak has its end., This year, after nearly 40 years of dominance, Democrats are staring down the possibility their reign is coming to a close. With ballots in this vote-by-mail state already heading out to voters, polls show Democrat Tina Kotek, a former state House speaker, running neck-and-neck with Republican Christine Drazan, the previous state House GOP leader., Oregonians are angsty after years of COVID-19 lockdowns, and amid a worsening homelessness crisis that has been particularly acute in Portland, the state's largest city. And they're not fans of outgoing Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat whom polls show has the lowest approval rating of any governor in the country., That's one hurdle for Kotek, 56. She worked closely with the governor to pass progressive legislation over nine years as speaker of the state House, but has begun to attack Brown's record in ads and public appearances as she works to create distance., ""Oregon can do great things,"" she said recently. ""We have not had the leadership in our governor's office over the last several years to make that happen, and I am tired of it."", Another challenge is Betsy Johnson, 71, the former Democratic state senator who grew wary enough of Oregon's progressive trajectory that she jettisoned her party registration last year. She's now mounting a well-funded centrist campaign for governor that, though unlikely to succeed, could siphon away Democratic votes., ""Our screwed up political system doesn't offer any good choices,"" Johnson says in one of the many campaign ads that have smothered the state's airwaves since early this year. ""I'm not captive to the far left or the far right."", And then there's Drazan, 50, a two-term lawmaker who smiles sunnily on the campaign trail as she tears into the long legislative records of Kotek and Johnson, painting the two women as one and the same., ""Our state is in a very, very difficult position after a decade of single-party control,"" Drazan often says. ""I ask Oregonians: Are you better off today than you were four years ago? If the answer is no, then the answer is change."", Oregon has no campaign contribution limits, and the three candidates have raised more than $55 million in total this year, shattering previous records. That's partly because of huge national interest from the Republican Governors Association and Democratic Governors Association, which have poured money into Oregon., Nike co-founder Phil Knight, a billionaire and Oregon's richest man, is taking unprecedented interest in defeating Democrats this year. He spent $3.75 million backing Johnson, and, when her polling numbers didn't budge, cut a $1 million check to Drazan., The race is tight enough that Democrats are calling in reinforcements --including President Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren., ""Oregon is viewed as a state that has always been in the forefront of change — positive change,"" Biden said in a recent stop in Portland. ""That's why this race going to matter so much — not only for 2022, but for 2024."", Republicans are bringing in outside help, too., Drazan has acknowledged Biden won the 2020 election, and has not courted an endorsement from former President Donald Trump. Instead she's campaigned with politicians whose path to office she hopes to emulate: Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Republicans who won over left-leaning states., ""I believe in her, I believe in her plan,"" Hogan said at a campaign event in September.

Today, the forest could help New England meet its climate objectives. But how should it be managed? Susan Sharon of Maine Public Radio reports. Spanning more than 10 million acres, the North Woods are almost entirely privately owned. Historically, they supported paper mills and towns that sprung up around them. More recently, Maine's paper industry has been in decline. Instead, large landowners like the Seven Islands Land Company have tried to diversify, turning higher quality logs into lumber at this sawmill in Ashland and using the lower quality wood for pulp and paper and to burn for heat. President and CEO Dan LaMontagne says sustainable management depends on markets for both. So as you thin the forest, as you remove the lower quality material, you're actually improving the growing conditions for the material that you leave that will grow into the higher value product. And those higher quality products, building materials and furniture also store carbon. According to the Maine governor's task force on carbon, they help the North Woods capture and store 75% of the state's annual carbon emissions. Research suggests that by improving forest management, increasing conservation and expanding the use of wood in building materials, the percentage could rise. The potential is huge, and we have the opportunity here in Maine specifically to be a leader on this whole front. Alec Giffen is a forest scientist with the New England Forestry Foundation, who also serves on the state's carbon task force. He says the foundation's research, currently under peer review, shows that if timber stands were managed to grow older and bigger trees, all of New England could benefit. Our analysis shows that the amount of carbon that the forest could remove within the next 25 or 30 years amounts to about 30% of the total emissions reductions that we need in New England. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently awarded the Forestry Foundation and its partners $30 million to apply the research on 100,000 acres across Maine and New England. Dr. William Moomaw, a climate scientist and professor at Tufts University, is skeptical that significant carbon savings can be achieved on timberlands that are harvested every few decades. For every tree that's cut, more than half of it ends up as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A lot of research just simply says that there is no way you can harvest a forest and store more carbon than by letting it grow. Instead, Moomaw points to a recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that calls for setting aside at least 30% of land, inland waters and oceans by 2030 to reduce the risks of climate change and to protect biodiversity. But Mark Berry, the forest program director for The Nature Conservancy in Maine, says when it comes to carbon storage, there's room for many forms of conservation. From establishing large ecological reserves, where essentially nature gets to take its course, to maintaining a commercial working forest that helps to keep the larger landscape intact and connects those reserves with each other. The one point on which everyone agrees is that keeping the landscape forested is the most important climate goal, and that means compensating landowners not only for wood products but for the other ecological and carbon storage benefits they provide.

For one Louisiana tribe, sea-level rise and erosion threaten their cultural sites. In response, the tribe is using discarded oyster shells to build reefs. WWNO's Halle Parker reports from New Orleans. Growing up, Lori Stewart remembers shrimping, crabbing and fishing were a way to be with her family. And now she has kids of her own. I didn't see it as a teaching lesson as a kid, but now as an adult, I know that, you know, that was a teaching lesson. It taught me how to live off the land. Living off the land for the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe is getting harder and harder as more of south Louisiana's coastline is lost to the Gulf of Mexico. Stewart says sea-level rise and erosion threaten earthen mounds built by her ancestors. Some might have held houses or been used for ceremonies. Some are old cemeteries, deepening their importance. This is where our ancestors grew up. This is where they're buried. That's why Stewart and her tribe are working to protect them. Recently, volunteers with a local nonprofit traveled down to the southern tip of Terrebonne Parish to help with a unique solution. #1: Today, we will be building our fifth recycled oyster reef since the program started in 2014. Gloved up and ready to go, volunteers with the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana form several human chains, leading from giant 2-ton bags of oysters to boats captained by tribe members. #2: Remember - you got to put these ones in there, too. #3: Little ones. #2: Oh, no, that's... Once the boats are piled high with smaller 40-pound sacks of oyster shell, they putter off down Bayou Pointe-au-Chien to Bernard's Mound, or as Donald Dardar from the tribe says in French... La butte a Bernard - that's what it was always called. Once there, the group unloads, stacking and splashing the sacks of shell near the mound's edge. When it's done, the reef will stretch about 300 feet along Bernard's Mound and some others nearby, using around 150 tons of oyster shell. Dardar hopes it will succeed in keeping the mound here, despite the state's land-loss crisis. If we don't try and protect them, our next generation might not even see this. And we could talk about it, but, you know, it's not going to be there to show. These reefs are known as living shorelines. They act as a barrier against erosion, helping to keep the land in place using materials from nature, says Darrah Bach, the coalition's Oyster Shell Recycling Program coordinator. The beauty of this project is it's self-sustaining. We're creating an ecosystem that hopefully will last for a very long time, if not forever, you could say. You know, it's often said that oyster reefs can outpace sea-level rise. So as the water rises in the Gulf, the reefs will grow upwards as well. The nonprofit collects shells from any willing New Orleans restaurant, then disinfects and recycles them for the community reefs. Not only does it preserve the land, but Bach says it creates new habitat underwater, too. They've seen it in action at their first Pointe-au-Chien reef around another eroding Indian mound. The area swarmed with marine life when Bach last went out, despite taking a hit from Hurricane Ida last year. We had live oysters growing from spat to sack size. We had mussels, crabs, barnacles, Gobi fish, shrimp - all sorts of little critters enjoying the reef habitat. The coalition expects to finish the new reef by the end of next year and will keep building more. The tribe is also looking for more ways to slow the loss of land around them. Dardar says the reefs won't be enough. We're washing away. And if nothing is done, for sure, we're going to just keep washing away. The tribe hopes this is just a start toward protecting their heritage and keeping the tribe's culture and identity alive.For NPR News, I'm Halle Parker in Pointe-au-Chien, La. ",National

The fire was caused by U.S. Forest Service controlled burns that escaped. Local officials say it destroyed at least 500 homes. From member station KUNM, Alice Fordham reports there's hope and trepidation about the money.(CROSSTALK) In Mora County - population about 4,000 - everyone's been touched by the fire - the biggest in New Mexico's recorded history. About 200 people crammed into a community meeting called by their congresswoman, Teresa Leger Fernandez. And I need to tell you, there was nobody in Congress who I didn't pull aside and tell what had happened here. For six months, she campaigned for legislation to compensate people. It was your grief. It was your hardship that I took and I shared with them. And I know it's really hard and it hasn't ended, and it's not going to end for years and years. The law is loosely modeled on what happened after a planned burn got out of control in Los Alamos, N.M., in 2000. FEMA managed the process then, and most claims were handled within about two years. Here, the area is more rural, and claims could be more complicated. Many complain about FEMA's initial response. And all of you are very frustrated, had been very frustrated. Gerard Stolar is here with a team from the agency. He says over 4,000 households applied for help. About 1,300 have received money. I would just ask you to be patient and continue to be persistent because some significant help is on the way. People don't have much choice. But that doesn't mean they're optimistic. Doreen Sandoval keeps asking for help with her flooded home and road. Oh, they just don't listen. They just deny me every time I go. So far, FEMA officials and local people say a big challenge has been that people in this rural area don't always have conventional documentation. Local lawyer Antonia Roybal-Mack is trying to help.- I think there's a lot of limitations within FEMA. There is no trust. And when you're saying trust me to do the right thing even though I have not done the right thing till this point - is a really difficult pill to swallow. She wants the agency to hire locals who understand issues like loss of firewood, hunting permits or wells. For now, FEMA has until mid-November to come up with draft regulations. Then there will be a public comment period. The earliest people might be able to apply for the new funding is around the new year. For NPR News, I'm Alice Fordham in Mora, N.M. ",Climate

Diaa Hadid/NPR hide caption, A traditional Pakistani fishing boat, or kashti, laden with passengers, traverses a flooded lake in the southern district of Dado., DADO, Pakistan – On a recent morning, a woman in a black robe and face veil picked through muddy water and clambered into the hull of a small traditional fishing vessel decorated with bright geometric shapes and woodcarvings. A teenage girl followed, hauling bulging shopping bags. A few men crammed onto the bow and stern while a barefoot fisherman pushed the boat away from land with a shout., This impromptu ferry service — which launches from a spot where a highway abruptly plunges into water — is one of the only ways for travelers in the Dado region of southern Pakistan to reach nearby villages, which recent floods transformed into islands. Unprecedented monsoon rains this summer left a third of Pakistan under water, and Dado was one of the hardest-hit areas. Even weeks after the rains subsided, the lake they left behind still stretched for miles over submerged homes and swaths of farmland. With climate change making such extreme weather more likely, boat services such as this may well be part of a playbook of how Pakistanis will manage future floods., It started in late August with emergency rescues from the floods, said 17-year-old fisherman Noor Hussain, who works alongside his brother manning one of the boats, known as kashti. ""So many people had been left stranded,"" he said. ""People were saying, 'If you have boats, then bring them and rescue us.' They even offered us money."", From that chaotic situation, local fishermen quickly established a boat bus service of sorts. There's a route of established stops — some two or three dozen — but no set schedule. Boats only move once fishermen have packed them with passengers. It's unclear how many of the hundreds of thousands of residents in the area have taken boat rides, but they're a lifeline for those who can afford it and a godsend for fishermen who face diminishing stocks in the stressed and polluted waterways of southern Pakistan. Hussain said he left his studies for this work. At $1.30 a passenger, six passengers a ride, he and his brother make a profit of about $25 a day., A fisherman (right) smiles on a boat as he ferries passengers to a partially submerged village in southern Pakistan. Diaa Hadid/NPR hide caption, A fisherman (right) smiles on a boat as he ferries passengers to a partially submerged village in southern Pakistan., He revved up the outboard motor rigged to his kashti and puttered past submerged villages, now identifiable only by mosque domes and treetops. To navigate the lake waters that stretch as far as the eye can see, he uses the powerlines that marked the route of the now-underwater highway. He tries to follow them as much as possible to keep off people's lands underneath the water., Land owners, he explained, are sensitive about boats on their flooded property. ""They tell us, 'It does not belong to you, this is our land,' "" he said with a laugh and a shrug. He gestured to a small school of fish near his boat. ""We aren't even allowed to fish here,"" he added. ""They say, 'The fish are on our land.' "", He briefly cut the motor so his brother could pick out garbage tangled in the propeller. As they neared a partially submerged village called Gozo, a handful of people crowded by the stop on the muddy shore hoping for food aid. There was none., Aboard another boat was Hanifa Lund, who was heading to Johi, one of the biggest towns in the flood lake with a population of 200,000. She was returning home from what is now the mainland with her youngest boy, seven-year-old Haji., ""He had malaria. It's the heat and flood waters,"" she lamented. ""It's making us all sick."", To make matters worse, food is hard for her to come by. Lund said she had borrowed money to feed her family bread and black tea., Lund's home was washed away in the floods, and they were bunking with her mother in a one-bedroom slum in Johi. ""We might have to shelter under a tree,"" fretted Lund. ""My mother is a poor woman, she can't keep hosting us."" Out of desperation, Lund said she and other homeless residents even held a noisy demonstration outside a government office in the regional town of Dado, for which this district is named. ""We marched and shouted but got nothing,"" she said., When they arrived in Johi, the fisherman steering the boat jostled for space in a busy jetty carved out of the submerged garden of a local college., With an enormous grunt, porter Ali Asghar wrestled a 50-pound sack of potatoes from a pile packed into the hull of a small boat. His feet wobbled in the mud, and fishermen held him still as they shouted encouragement. The potato sack on his shoulders, he staggered to a nearby donkey cart and threw it down with a thump. Working swiftly, the 28-year-old said he could do three boatloads a day, for about $1.50 a haul, better money than he was making as a donkey cart driver transporting vegetables to market., A man herds his buffalos through an alley submerged in water in the village of Gozo. Diaa Hadid/NPR hide caption, A man herds his buffalos through an alley submerged in water in the village of Gozo., A family arrived at the Johi jetty by motorbike, and climbed into a waiting boat. The women and children squeezed into the hull beside their motorbike. ""It's all we have,"" remarked one of the women, Zinat, who only has one name. ""The floods took our home, my cows, my buffalo, my goats."", They were heading to town to find a doctor for Zinat's daughter, Benazir, who snuggled under her scarf. She was sick with fever and diarrhea. Zinat said she knew clinics were overcrowded and medicines were hard to find, but she was desperate. She borrowed money from her mother to get on this boat., By the time the family reached the mainland about 40 minutes later, Zinat herself was overcome by the blazing heat and her husband helped her off the boat., It was dusk. The jetty road was lined with tents of people made homeless by the floods. Women built small fires on the asphalt to make dinner. Goats and cows were tethered to the highway railing. Children ran about., One of the fishermen, Zakariya Mallah, 52, dropped off his final lot of passengers for the day. He was preparing to head home, by boat, and he said he wanted to make it before nightfall because the flood waters were precarious, with so much life lying under the surface., Soon, he said, the waters would recede. He will return to fishing in a nearby lake, now refreshed with monsoonal rains. But, as for his passengers who have lost so much, it's not clear where they will go or how they will get there., Remains of a flood-destroyed village.

Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption, A home is surrounded by floodwater from the Pecatonica River in Freeport, Illinois on March 18, 2019., After a torrential downpour began on Aug. 7, the Pecatonica River jumped its banks in Freeport, Ill. and flooded the basement of Laurie Thomas' family home, nearly to the ceiling., This latest was Freeport's fifth major flood in just the past four years. Thomas and her mother have experienced flooding at least 15 times in the past 20 years., Climate change is intensifying hurricanes and triggering sea-level rise along the coast, but it's also bringing more rainfall and frequent flooding to inland river communities. While some parts of the Mississippi River basin experienced drought conditions this year, others had to deal with extreme rain., Flash flooding in St. Louis broke a century-old rainfall record this summer. Increased rainfall overwhelmed the main water treatment facility in Jackson, Mississippi.

It's causing economic strain, impacting quality of life, and forcing people to make hard decisions about whether to stay or leave., Last year, the city of Freeport, with over $3 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, launched a program to buy and remove homes along the river and return the land to floodplains. City officials say that the average home on the east side, the historically Black part of town, is valued at around $15,000. Homeowners can be offered up to an additional $31,000., Thomas says that's just not enough money for her mother to pick up and start over elsewhere. She, and some neighbors, would rather take their chances with the river., ""People have always lived over here and there's always been the Pecatonica [River], but lately the floods, they've been worse,"" Thomas says. ""But they've been worse everywhere else too. That's not a reason to kick people out of their homes."", Buyout or not, adapting to increased rainfall and flooding in the region will mean transforming river communities, like Freeport. But for these efforts to succeed, they'll need support and substantial resources. Otherwise, families like Thomas' will continue to opt out altogether., Laurie Thomas displays a photo she made of flooding that occurred earlier this year in front of the home where her mother has lived for nearly 50 years. Mark Hoffman/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel hide caption, Laurie Thomas displays a photo she made of flooding that occurred earlier this year in front of the home where her mother has lived for nearly 50 years., When it rains, it pours, The Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk – a journalism partnership that includes more than 14 newsrooms – asked climate data nonprofit Climate Central to analyze 50 years of rainfall patterns, using data from the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Findings show that the eastern half of the U.S. is getting far wetter on average, with some areas – including parts of the Mississippi River basin – now receiving up to 8 more inches of rain each year than 50 years ago., ""Climate change models show further increases are likely in coming years,"" said Climate Central data scientist Jen Brady, who helped with the analysis., And when it rains, it pours, based on rainfall intensity data. Not only has the average yearly rainfall increased in parts of the basin, but it's also falling harder in many places, according to the Climate Central analysis., The trend is largely tied to heat, according to Pat Guinan, Missouri's state climatologist and a professor at the University of Missouri. As greenhouse gasses from fossil fuels heat the Earth, that warming extends to the oceans and the Gulf of Mexico — a primary source of the atmospheric moisture for the Eastern U.S. Warming oceans produce more water vapor, and a warming atmosphere can hold more moisture, which can then deliver more precipitation in short windows of time., ""We're getting warmer and we're getting wetter,"" said Guinan. ""We are in an unprecedented wet period."", Guinan said recent decades have given rise to a stark divide seen across the continental U.S., with the western half of the country becoming increasingly arid and prone to drought, while the eastern half is faced with exceptional moisture, often delivered in bursts., A farm in Atchison County, Missouri sits under 4 feet of water on June 14, 2011 after major floods breached two levees in northwest Missouri.

Acres of corn and soy fields once lined its shores, but after a nearby levee suffered seven breaches in the Flood of 2019, the cropland was ruined., Instead of rebuilding the levee and replanting the crops, Atchison County decided to let the floodplain be a floodplain. The local levee board proposed a setback, moving one of the levees that breached back and restoring the area to floodplain. Knee-high prairie grass now covers the open space, providing a greener, more sustainable form of flood control., ""It's nuts how bad things were,"" said Regan Griffin, a local farmer and Atchison Levee Board member.

The board hopes to set this levee back in the future., With rivers pushed to the brink, municipalities have struggled to keep their residents safe. Many across the basin — like Atchison — are shifting away from traditional mitigation tactics, such as levees and berms, to make room for the water instead., ""The old way isn't working for today's population. That has resulted in rethinking the engineering solution versus a new look at the role nature can play,"" said Laura Lightbody, project director of The Pew Charitable Trusts' Flood-Prepared Communities project., Research has found that these solutions successfully mitigate flooding. Proactive buyouts provide permanent solutions for communities in harm's way. When paired with those buyouts, levee setbacks reduced flood risks in every studied scenario in the Mississippi River. The resulting floodplains offer opportunities for recreation, ecotourism and increased ecosystem services., ""There's more and more research that's making it more compelling...and it's often less costly,"" Lightbody said. ""I think that's why we're seeing more of it."", However, infrastructure updates are also expensive, and many small towns lack the capital., Congress has slowly begun to direct agencies to craft programs that offer communities more support. For instance, in 2020, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) launched the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program geared toward funding locally-led projects that fortify areas before disasters strike. This October, FEMA will have $2.3 billion for such projects — a windfall compared to past years, but still a fraction of the $460 billion spent on disaster response between 2005 and 2019., So far, inland Mississippi River communities have received a smaller percentage of BRIC dollars than coastal states, according to a Headwaters Economics analysis., Eric Letvin, FEMA's Deputy Assistant Administrator for Mitigation, said the agency was working to make the money more accessible to small towns like those in the river basin., ""Some states have more hazard mitigation staff than others and are able to help provide more assistance and help generate applications,"" he said., But Pew's Lightbody says communities need to come up with local solutions as well. As she sees it, the federal government just doesn't have enough money., ""They don't have the resources to fully rebuild communities time and time again,"" says Lightbody., It's not clear how river communities will look a century from now. But most experts agree: Change is necessary to create a better and safer future. Levees and floodwalls alone aren't working anymore. Flood risk will continue to increase, and communities will need to make room for the water.

https://www.npr.org/2022/10/17/1128354266/coal-companies-use-bankruptcy-and-asset-transfers-to-shed-obligations,2022-10-17,Coal companies use bankruptcy and asset transfers to shed obligations,Dave Mistich,"This week we're taking a look at coal company bankruptcies and mine reclamation as part of a joint investigation taken on by reporters from Bloomberg News and NPR. Coal companies have used bankruptcy and asset transfers to shed their obligations to their workers and to the environment. One of these companies is Alpha Metallurgical Resources. NPR's Dave Mistich brings us this look at Alpha and how environmental cleanup is going at sites they used to own and how it's affected the local community. Today we're going to be going up on Sundial. Junior Walk of Coal River Mountain Watch is an annoyance to coal companies with mines near his home in Raleigh County, W.Va. A few years back, he was arrested for sitting on one of Alpha's properties to keep them from mining. Walk, who's lived all 32 years of his life in this area, spends his days trying to hold operators to environmental regulations. Around these parts, he says underground mining has been mostly phased out in favor of mountaintop removal. This just erases tracts of land, turns them from one of the most vibrant, biologically diverse forests on the entire planet into a bare rock moonscape where nothing will ever really grow again. We load up in Walk's green Subaru station wagon to drive around the area as he keeps an eye on nearby mining operations. Many mines here are owned by Alpha or used to be. Walk takes us up a narrow dirt road. Tree branches and briars scrape across the hood and roof of the car. All righty. After a short hike up a hill, we make our way to a clearing. Go to the left right here. Here, to avoid the risk of trespassing, Walk puts a drone up in the air to get a look at the Ed White Mine, a giant surface mine once owned by Alpha. When they see something potentially off, Walk and the others at Coal River Mountain Watch send their concerns to state regulators. Sometimes small fines are handed down. Other times, though, Walk says, regulators just give these companies, especially the most profitable ones, a warning or simply work with them to revise the terms of permit. For Walk, who worked for a short time in the coal industry when he was younger, his current mission is personal. He points to a giant map on the wall of the offices of Coal River Mountain Watch, noting the potential dangers that loom nearby. That includes the Brushy Fork Impoundment, an enormous dam owned by Alpha that holds back coal slurry. Holds back 7.8 billion gallons of toxic waste. And my parents' house is right here. So if you look at the top of that field, if it was to burst open and come right out this holler, they'd be some of the first people to die. Alpha says on its website that its impoundments are constructed and inspected under federal regulations. The company filed for bankruptcy in August 2015. Since then, the company has transferred more than 300 mining permits to smaller companies. That's more than it currently holds. Along with those permits, Alpha also got rid of its responsibility to reclaim the land it mined. Coal companies are supposed to restore the land under federal law. This is all spelled out in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, known as SMCRA. But University of Chicago assistant law professor Josh Macey says through corporate maneuvers like bankruptcy and asset transfers, many big coal companies have been able to shed all sorts of liabilities. The basic idea was that coal companies tried to silo or separate many of their environmental and labor obligations into subsidiaries or certain affiliates and place the coal mines that they viewed as valuable assets into other affiliates. Congress has been forced to step in time and again to fund worker obligations like pensions and black lung benefits, passing most of the cost onto taxpayers. To get a mining permit, coal companies need to be insured for the reclamation that's supposed to happen when they're done mining. But those policies don't always cover the full cost of cleanup. Because of that, Macey says taxpayers could end up footing the bill for these obligations, too. And it's very, very hard to see how that promise will be fulfilled in a world in which coal mining companies rarely have the resources to pay for reclamation right now. In a deal approved by regulators in West Virginia and Kentucky, Alpha handed over about 230 mining permits to the smaller Lexington Coal Company along with more than $300 million to fund the environmental cleanup. Since taking over these permits, Lexington Coal has racked up a slew of violations for not securing potential environmental hazards. And this lack of cleanup has created some costly problems for those who live near these mines. All of my land has always been dry as powder. There wasn't no water whatsoever on it. That's 70-year-old Miles Hatfield of Hardy, Ky. Hatfield, a former coal miner, lived next to the Love Branch Mine, once owned by Alpha and now on the hands of Lexington. Over time, he started to notice polluted red mine water. After they shut down the mines, that's when it kind of started appearing little by little. A couple of years ago, water from the mine damaged his home to the point where he fell through the floor of his dining room. Since then, the red water from the Love Branch Mine has continued to flow into Hatfield's property, forcing him to move out and pay rent for another home. I've lost about everything - everything in my shop, everything I had stored. I kept moving it from a wet place to a dry place, and then the water would catch up. So I basically lost everything I had. Regulators in Kentucky determined that the red water flowing on to Hatfield's property was from the mine and fined Lexington $30,000 in June. Similar stories next to former Alpha Mines now owned by Lexington are playing out in southern West Virginia. Beautiful neighborhood. Yeah. In Mingo County, W.Va., between the towns of Musick and Pie is the Mountaineer Mine. Thirty-six-year-old Gary VanNatter, another former coal miner, attributes the frequent flooding on his property to mining and a lack of reclamation. They mine underneath us. But now it's like a river underneath us. I mean, it's literally water. It comes out of the ground. VanNatter shows us cracks in the foundation of his home and his aboveground swimming pool that's sinking into the earth. Just across a fence, the ground is opening up in his neighbor's yard. I might have to move. I might not get what I got in this home here, you know? And if I have to leave here, that's just - man, that's gut-wrenching. The Mountaineer Mine hasn't produced any coal since 2013. But Lexington Coal Company wound up with the permit and the responsibility to clean up the land as part of the deal with Alpha. State regulator documents say the Mountaineer Mine has contributed to the flooding on VanNatter's land. He says he isn't surprised that Alpha offloaded that permit and the others. They done that because they knew that there's going to be future problems. In my mind, why would you - and Lexington - I can't believe that Lexington was crazy enough to buy all these mines knowing that, hey; it's all going to have to be supposedly restored back to the way it was before you mined it. And it can never go back. In a statement to both Bloomberg and NPR, Alpha says it has conducted itself ethically throughout the course of its operations and noted the funding it has provided to smaller operators, like Lexington, who have taken over its mines. Alpha also pointed out that these asset transfers were approved by multiple regulators. Lexington didn't answer questions but has said in the past that it strives for full compliance with environmental regulations. Dave Mistich, NPR News.(, """") ",Business

To determine that, scientists have begun listening to glaciers using underwater microphones called hydrophones., So, what do melting glaciers sound like?, ""You hear something that sounds a lot like firecrackers going off or bacon frying. It's a very impulsive popping noise, and each of those pops is generated by a bubble bursting out into the water,"" Grant Deane, a research oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who told Morning Edition., Deane says he was inspired by a 2008 paper co-authored by renowned oceanographer Wolfgang Berger, and hopes that listening and understanding these glacial noises will help him and his colleagues predict sea level rise., ""If we can count the bubbles being released into the water from the noises that they make, and if we know how many bubbles are in the ice, we can figure out how quickly the ice is melting. We need to know how quickly the ice is melting because that tells us how quickly the glaciers are going to retreat. We need to understand these things if we're going to predict sea level rise accurately,"" Deane says., And predicting sea level rise is crucial, as hundreds of millions of people are at risk around the world — including the 87 million Americans who live near the coastline. Deane says that even a modest rise in sea levels could have devastating impacts on those communities.",Climate

But as Susan Phillips of member station WHYY in Philadelphia reports, these steam loop systems could be a climate change solution. The steam that travels through 41 miles of pipe below Philadelphia's streets is generated at a red brick building built in 1915. Officially known as district energy systems, most of us notice this underground network only when residual steam escapes from the sidewalk grates. It's like a ring of steam where you have a bunch of people who are connected to that ring or are taking their steam and they're using it. Mike Ancona is the operations manager with Vicinity Energy, which owns and operates Philadelphia's steam loop system. The plant illustrates the evolution of electric generation. High-arched ceilings are lined with tiles, and detailed brickwork points to an era when electricity had begun to replace gas lighting in earnest. When this place was built, like, a hundred years ago - right? - these boilers ran on coal. There would have been a 60,000-ton coal pile sitting here. The days of coal-generated steam are long gone. During World War II, the plant switched to oil. Today, modern natural gas boilers generate electricity sold to the grid. The waste heat makes the steam. Ancona says this highly efficient and flexible system could easily ditch natural gas and replace it with renewable energy or lower-carbon fuel to generate that steam. In fact, Vicinity Energy has begun to do that with the steam loop system it owns in Boston, says CEO Bill DiCroce. And the building owners don't have to do a thing - so no major retrofits, no big capital expense on their part, no disruption. We become the easy way to decarbonize huge swaths of building space in urban cores. And it's not just cities that can benefit. Dozens of colleges have district energy systems in place where the fuel source is getting switched in order to lower a university's carbon footprint. But in Philadelphia, two federal agencies plan to switch from Vicinity Energy's district steam system to natural gas boilers - this despite President Biden's commitment to tackling climate change and his executive order mandating federal agencies work to limit emissions. These include Amtrak's big train station and buildings operated by the National Park Service, like the historic Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell Center.This angers environmental groups that support the steam loop system because of how easy it would be to use it to cut the city's overall carbon emissions. Joseph Ingrao is an attorney who worked with the Clean Air Council. The federal government has pledged over $14 million to installing these natural gas boilers that can only burn natural gas for heat. An Amtrak spokesperson says the new gas boilers will be cheaper and more reliable. The National Park Service says switching to natural gas will cut its carbon emissions. But that could not be independently verified. Vicinity's DiCroce says the environment should be taken into consideration. Those who decide to lean towards the cheapest alternative will make different decisions with those who are trying to look forward to a less carbon-intensive future. And they'll be willing to pay a little bit more for the advantage of being better for the planet. For NPR News, I'm Susan Phillips in Philadelphia.('S "" (INSTRUMENTAL)"") ",Energy

We're going to hear from the first place where farmers have been totally cut off from Colorado River water, central Arizona. As NPR's Kirk Siegler reports, the crisis renews questions about the viability of growing thirsty crops in a desert. Will Thelander has heard it all before. Yes, this harsh and hot patch of ground south of Phoenix that he farms is a desert. Yes, farms gulp up about 80% of all the water in the Colorado River basin. But he's tired of all the shots. They're like, well, cities use less water. OK, what has a bigger environmental impact - you know, an open farm like this or the city of Phoenix? In Phoenix, you'd hardly know there's an historic drought. They still have water. But this year, farmers here in Pinal County had their Colorado River pumps shut off. Thelander is fallowing half of his land. And at 35 years old, he's starting to get worried about the future of farming in the southwest. They didn't magically pick a desert where it was hard to get water to to start farms. There's a reason all this was done. He means as long as you have reliable irrigation, you can grow all kinds of things in the desert southwest, ironically because it barely rains. From October to May, it's warm and sunny, and storms don't ruin crops. You can't just go, well, it's a desert and they're out of water, so we'll grow food elsewhere. Well, these industries have taken 50 to 100 years to establish. You don't just go, hey, we'll grow elsewhere. It's complicated. Fifty to 100 years ago, people thought the Colorado River was infinite, America's Nile. So they built a complicated and elaborate plumbing system of canals to create an enormous agricultural economy in the desert. #1: Thus, the first thunders of man's determination to conquer the Colorado River. When the Hoover Dam was built and Lake Mead filled, cheap, federally subsidized water allowed farmers to grow pecans in New Mexico, alfalfa and cotton in Arizona, greens and citrus in California. #2: And so a vigorous modern culture replaces that of a bygone age in the southwest. The wastes of strung native growth become vast irrigated citrus farms. Well, that almost mythical river doesn't exist anymore, says Jack Schmidt, who runs the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University. There have been warnings and fears about whether or not there was enough water before the scepter of climate change ever reared up. Schmidt says farmers in central Arizona, particularly, were always warned this day could come. Under the century-old river law, they're last in line for irrigation in a megadrought. Ted Cooke manages the Central Arizona Project. It's a federal canal system built in the '60s so Arizona farmers could tap into excess Colorado River water. We are two years or less away from not being able to get any water past the dam in Lake Mead. That's.... That's pretty extraordinary. It's pretty extraordinary. So something has to be done. Something is going to have to change, or the southwest is going to lose their agriculture. What farmer Will Thelander is doing for now is planting a new desert crop called guayule. It requires a quarter of the water that his traditional cotton and alfalfa do. So, like, I'm hoping on this crop right here that it's going to rain, and then I don't water this for another three weeks because it's a desert crop. Guayule produces a natural desert rubber. Right now, only 74 acres of Thelander's farm has been converted to it. But if the economics continue to work out, you know, I think this could be a huge crop for the southwest. The crop, he thinks, could make farming sustainable here in a hotter, drier world. American tire companies are already pumping money into its cultivation.Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Phoenix.

The clinic is run by Neha Mankani, a midwife who leads the Mama Baby Fund., Neha Mankani peeks into tarpaulin tents pitched in rows between cotton fields near the southern Pakistani village of Sheikh Daro. They flap in a hot wind that whips up dust that grits the eyes and coats the tattered clothes of the men, women and children who've been living here since they were made homeless by Pakistan's devastating floods this summer., ""I'm looking for pregnant women, and I'm trying to mobilize them so they can come to my makeshift clinic,"" says Mankani, a midwife who leads the Karachi-based Mama Baby Fund. The small charity has been running pop-up clinics for pregnant women in flood-affected areas, like this encampment established by a Canadian aid group, the Al-Qaim Charity Foundation., The needs are unimaginably vast in areas where Pakistan was pummeled by torrential monsoon rains for weeks. Officials estimate more than 7 million people were made homeless. Several hundred thousand of them, at least, are living in encampments and by roadsides across southern Pakistan. Among those affected, says the U.N.'s Population Fund, are nearly 130,000 pregnant women in need of urgent health services., Those women are particularly vulnerable. Even before the floods, Pakistan had one of Asia's highest maternal mortality rates. In the southern province of Sindh, one of the worst affected by the floods, the U.N. estimated that more than a fifth of all people in the province were facing high levels of acute food insecurity and were in need of urgent action to shore up their food consumption., The midwife Neha Mankani peeks out from a tent flap of her pop-up clinic. Outside, dozens of women wait with their children for infant formula and reassurances that their unborn babies are doing well. Diaa Hadid/NPR hide caption, The midwife Neha Mankani peeks out from a tent flap of her pop-up clinic. Outside, dozens of women wait with their children for infant formula and reassurances that their unborn babies are doing well., ""The most urgent problem we have is malnutrition,"" says Farhana Menon, a senior official in Sindh's provincial health ministry, where she oversees the needs of pregnant women in particular. Menon says the ministry has dispatched ambulances to encampments, so they can ferry out women who need to give birth, but the need is enormous., ""Some people have given birth in schools. They've given birth in boats. They've given birth in tents,"" says Mankani, referring to displaced women who are sheltering in public schools and others who rely on boats for transport because their villages are surrounded by floodwater., One of Mankani's challenges is convincing women in conservative areas that she can be trusted to see and touch their swollen bellies. So she's bought along a lure: She tells women crammed in a line for drinking water that pregnant women can have an ultrasound if they visit her clinic. It's a special treat in rural areas where even in ordinary times, health care is ramshackle. ""It's going to be a pull to get people to come to my clinic,"" she explains., Mankani need not have bothered., A few minutes after she speaks to the women, she returns to her makeshift clinic, which her team has set up in an empty blue tent at the encampment's entrance. There's already a crowd of women and children waiting outside. ""Oh! I didn't expect so many people!"" she exclaims and rushes in. In one corner, volunteers have placed a charpoy, a daybed made from wood and rope, to examine patients., Mankani beckons the women in. ""One at a time!"" she calls., Mankani the midwife checks the fetal heartbeat of a pregnant woman. As she works, other women waiting to be seen cluster around the makeshift clinic's fly-screen windows. Diaa Hadid/NPR hide caption, Mankani the midwife checks the fetal heartbeat of a pregnant woman. As she works, other women waiting to be seen cluster around the makeshift clinic's fly-screen windows., A pregnant woman walks in, holding a wailing toddler. Mankani asks her to lie down, raises her colorful, thin cotton shirt. She presses her Doppler – a fetal heart monitor – against the woman's swollen belly. A steady thump emerges. The baby's fine, but the woman needs support. She's dizzy, and Mankani rummages through her boxes to give her oral rehydration salts and iron pills., Mankani turns her attention to the crying toddler. The boy's mother explains he's not getting enough food. He's got diarrhea, too. There's an added complication: He's got cerebral palsy and has been having seizures., The boy needs a doctor, not a midwife, but Mankani's all they've got. She gives the boy nutritional supplements that she pulls out of a stack of boxes heaped in a corner., A rhythm emerges. A volunteer calls in one woman at a time from the noisy crowd outside. Through social worker Moomal Mallah, who translates from Sindhi, the local language, Mankani chats with her new clients while checking for fetal heartbeats. Maine-trained midwife Jahan Zuberi, who works alongside Mankani, does the same., Mothers and babies need help as well. The midwives dole out vitamins, iron supplements, food supplements. Infant formula., The mobile ultrasound — which was meant to lure women in — keeps breaking down in the heat., Thirty-year-old Shehzadi walks in. She's only got one name, like many people in Pakistan. She's thin, with a small belly – five months along. And she's worried about where she'll give birth., ""She hopes she'll be back in her village before this one is born so she can give birth at a facility,"" Mankani explains. ""If not, she says she'll have to give birth in the camp."", Mankani checks the vital signs of a newborn baby. The mother was worried that he was not getting enough food.

A minute later, there were sighs of relief all around as Mankani told the mother that her baby was doing just fine., ​But Shehzadi is probably going to be in this encampment for months. The water still hasn't receded in some parts and rebuilding will be expensive. So Mankani gives Shehzadi a life-saving package: a delivery kit, with a sterile plastic sheet to give birth on. A razor to cut the umbilical cord. There's nappies for the baby. There's medicine for Shehzadi to prevent hemorrhage., Then, a man calls out from outside the tent: Mankani's team has to move. The encampment's religious leader wants to pray in this specific tent, and he won't consider using another. ""We're going to have to move! How will we move all our stuff?"" Mankani asks fellow midwife Zuberi., But they do. They shift their things to a nearby empty blue plastic tent – it's an informal school for displaced children, but the day's classes have ended, leaving a blackboard scrawled with the Urdu alphabet in one corner., The crowd of waiting women follow them. They've been waiting hours and it's hot — around 110 degrees., Many of the women are waiting for nutritional supplements for their little ones, Safoora, a woman who guesses she's 30 years old, has come with her seventh child. Her baby, Samira, wears grubby clothes concealing a thin, light body. Safoora says Samira has become feverish and sick and keeps throwing up the little food she can give her. Safoora tries to breastfeed, but she doesn't have much milk. She begins crying. ""We need help,"" she says. ""I want to save my baby."", One woman impatiently holds a crying, writhing baby to the new tent's fly-screen window to get the midwives' attention. She says the baby, Aziza, needs formula. Mankani, feeling the belly of another pregnant woman, calls out from inside the tent, ""You should breastfeed her!"", The woman shakes her head and calls back to Mankani, ""The mother is dead!"", Mankani walks to the tent window and the woman explains she is Aziza's aunt. The baby is too young for food. Mankani packs a plastic bag full of formula and hands it to the woman., Through another tent flap, a little blonde girl gestures and waves at the midwives. ""That's not a pregnant woman,"" says Mankani, shaking her head., The girl holds a baby to the flap for the midwives to see. He's so small, he looks like a doll. Mankani quickly lets the girl in. Her name is Ruksana; her brother is Zaman. Ruksana, like most women and girls here, is illiterate, and she doesn't know her age or the age of her brother. He was born last winter, she says., Mankani opens his mouth to check for teeth. ""He's one-and-a-half, at least,"" she says, but it's hard to believe, because Zaman looks so small, so fragile., Mankani gives the girl a bag full of vitamins and a powdered food supplement for them both. Ruksana touches Mankani's feet to show gratitude. With her brother on her hip, she weaves back out of the tent., A young girl named Ruksana holds her baby brother, Zaman, and food supplements that Mankani has given her. Ruksana explains that their mother is worried because she doesn't have enough food to give them.

But this – ""this is terrible,"" Mankani says. ""It's the worst I've seen."", It's the blazing heat in the open tents. The desperate need of mothers who've long been poor and malnourished, whose children are vulnerable to starvation and sickness – particularly from stagnating water that brings with it diarrhea as well as mosquitoes bearing dengue and malaria. Witnessing people struggle after losing everything to floods that were exacerbated by climate change that they've done nearly nothing to contribute to., And Mankani knows she's only treating a fraction of the women and children who need her care., She makes peace knowing she's doing all she can. ""I just have this philosophy that all the women I see myself – I know are getting respectful care,"" she says. That's part of why she does this, she says. She gives a tired laugh. ""And I'm just a little crazy."", Later the evening, Mankani messages from the fleabag hotel where she's staying in the nearby hub of Dado. She tells me her team saw 80 women in the camp in one day. She says the next day, she'll do it again., Dozens of women wait outside a pop-up clinic run by midwives in a tent encampment for families made homeless by Pakistan's unprecedented summer monsoon rains that caused widespread flooding.

Rebecca Blackwell/AP hide caption, ""Wrecked shrimp boats and other vessels littered the waterfront on San Carlos Island, Fort Myers Beach, FL, one week after Hurricane Ian made landfall., When Hurricane Ian roared ashore the Southwest Florida coast last week, it hit one of the fastest growing areas in the nation that's been fueled by sunshine and paved with lax growth management rules., Since 2010, NPR found, the area's population has rapidly swelled despite the increasing risk from powerful storms like Ian, which devastated some of those growing communities and narrowly missed others., Now, in the wake of the Category 4 hurricane, state and local leaders have promised to rebuild. Stronger building codes like the kind created after 1992's Hurricane Andrew will make the area more resilient to future storms, they say. But climate and planning experts warn that rebuilding along the crowded coast, following a decade of weakened rules governing development, is what helped create the disaster now unfolding., Specifically, they point to Florida's decision in 2011 to abolish the state agency that managed risky development even as threats from climate change deepened., ""The result is what we're looking at today,"" said Richard Grosso, a land use attorney who worked for the state in the 1980s helping implement the 1985 law that created the agency, Florida's Department of Community Affairs. ""We put way too many people, way too much private and public investment dollars than we should have, in those vulnerable areas."", Ian's confirmed death toll in Florida has now reached 89, with the number expected to rise. Damages in the state will likely exceed $60 billion, according to an early estimate from Karen Clark & Company, which does not include widespread losses from flooding. That would make it the costliest extreme weather disaster in Florida history., , The exact path of the surge and the flooding it brought will be calculated in the days to come, as federal agencies survey the damage. The U.S. Geological Survey has already documented record flooding inland along the Peace and Myakka rivers, where more than half the 40 monitors in place recorded new all-time highs. Agency field teams will try to retrieve data from monitors placed in advance of the storm, as well as measure water marks and weed lines to better determine the actual flooding., Despite increasing warnings about rising sea levels and the risk to coastal development, the Republican-controlled state legislature led the charge a decade ago to do away with the agency governing growth., During his campaign for governor in 2010, Sen. Rick Scott called the state's growth management rules a jobs killer. At the time, he said he was not convinced that humans were warming the planet and driving climate change, and called for a ""lean and limited government."", Scott was not available when NPR requested interviews over the last two weeks to talk about Hurricane Ian and weakened growth management laws. But when asked on CBS's Face the Nation Sunday if vulnerable communities should be rebuilt, Scott said they should., ""They're beautiful places. So what you really have to do is you have to say, I'm going to build, but I'm going to do it safely,"" he said. ""After this, we're going to learn that we're going to have to improve, are continuing to improve our building codes. And we also have to invest in issues such as sea level rise and things like that, flood mitigation programs."", In this aerial view, destruction left in the wake of Hurricane Ian is shown on October 02, 2022 in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption, ""The whole system was pretty much abandoned"", It's impossible to say how much different Florida would look had rules enacted in the 1970s and 80s that led to the creation of the statewide agency remained in place. Many of the places hit hardest predate those modern land use laws., But Grosso and others believe there would be less of the development that has made hurricanes so dangerous and costly., ""The whole system was pretty much abandoned,"" said Nancy Stroud, a planner and attorney who worked for the first secretary of the Florida Department of Community Affairs and helped write the laws. ""Places that used to be farms or mining areas are now just sizzling with growth."", The state first began enacting laws to manage growth in the 1970s as development companies like the Mackle Brothers, who developed Marco Island, and later the General Development Corporation, peddled real estate deals in installment plans to winter-weary northerners. To control the retirement communities and sprawling golf developments paving over wetlands and floodplains, the laws gave the state power to provide checks and balances that environmental regulations failed to accomplish., Regulations ""only dealt with individual impacts to that wetland or that water body. They didn't decide what was going to get built where,"" Grosso said. ""That's always been historically a decision that only city and county governments make. And the legislature realized that's really what determines the fate of an area."", John DeGrove, an architect of those early measures and the state's first secretary overseeing growth, understood development could never be stopped. Florida had done too good a job selling itself. But he said Florida needed to stop giving away its limited resources., To find a middle ground, the state needed ""a growth management system that has some teeth, that is well-funded, but that is favorable to all the key stakeholders,"" Grove said in a 2001 interview. He called it a potential win-win for the state and developers., The state paid particular attention to the coast and important resources like wetlands that absorb flooding and recharge water supplies, especially ones under development pressure. Areas like the Florida Keys and Green Swamp west of Disney World, were too risky to be left to local control., Members of Virginia Task Force 2 Urban Search and Rescue comb through the wreckage on Fort Myers Beach. Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption, Managing Growth Was Once Bipartisan, Under one of the new restrictive laws, both were designated areas of critical concern. For the Keys, an 180-mile long chain of islands, that included a cap on building to ensure safe hurricane evacuations along a single highway that connected the islands., Charlotte Harbor, where Ian made landfall, was also targeted for the designation, DeGrove wrote in 1988. But before it could be put in place, the Florida Supreme Court overturned the law saying it violated the state constitution for delegating legislative power. Rather than fight the case, the state pivoted to voluntary measures., To help with ""local reluctance"" over complying with the critical areas and other rules, the early planners pushed to create the statewide growth management agency., ""We tried to put a state agency in charge to make sure that what one local government did wasn't hurting people in other local governments that didn't vote for those people,"" Grosso said. ""That was the concept."", It was a concept that was bipartisan at the time. One of its biggest champions was Nathaniel Reed, a Republican who helped write the Endangered Species Act under Richard Nixon., Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, the Tampa mayor who succeeded both Sen. Bob Graham and Gov. Reuben Askew, both Democrats, continued to aggressively enforce growth rules., ""He was a big city mayor. He knew the realities of good and bad development,"" Grosso said, But developers disliked the checks and balances, such as limits on projects tied to road capacity and building big developments in rural areas where land was cheaper. They especially bristled over the requirement that developers pay for schools, police, roads and the other services that new housing would require., ""That was a huge effort to make sure that development, and developers, paid for the costs of growth,"" Stroud said. ""That was, in fact, one of the ways that the conflict about growth management really started heating up."", On the heels of the 2008 recession, Scott's campaign for job growth was an easy sell. With backing from the real estate development industry, Scott and Republican state lawmakers quickly dismantled the agency in 2011, despite warnings about the increasing risks from climate change., The move hurt local governments trying to enact restrictions to protect themselves from climate impacts and that now faced a hostile state, said Randy Parkinson, a Florida International University geologist who worked with local governments to assess climate impacts in community growth plans. In 2010, he was helping tiny Satellite Beach on Florida's Atlantic coast plan for rising seas., ""The concern at that time was the politics,"" he said. ""The concern was, well, 'We can't put climate change in there.' "", In places, including Lee County, growth has also sometimes outpaced people's ability to deal with the risks of storm damage. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been updating flood maps across Florida to account for sea level rise and increased flooding. That would require many more property owners to obtain flood insurance. But the process has been slow., New flood maps for unincorporated Lee County were just approved in June. They would significantly expand neighborhoods that need flood insurance on Pine Island and near the Caloosahatchee River hit hardest by Ian. But they don't take effect until Nov. 1., Sea level rise is also starting to overwhelm natural barriers that fight hurricanes around Charlotte Harbor, like the shallow mangrove-lined bay east of Fort Myers Beach where Ian flattened businesses and homes. It became the state's first aquatic preserve in the 1960s. But Parkinson said the growth and spread of the bay's mangroves aren't keeping up with sea level rise. The hardy storm barrier to storms will likely become open water in the next 40 years, he said., ""So now you lose the barriers and that just transfers the brunt of the attack,"" onto communities he said., After living through Hurricane Andrew and moving away from low-lying South Florida, Parkinson thinks rebuilding in areas expected to become even more vulnerable is a bad idea., ""After Andrew, I couldn't find my car. That was bad. But this? I look at the storm surge and my jaw just drops,"" he said. ""I guess we're just going to build back better. That's what I heard. I think that's impossible.""",Climate

Cobalt is a metal needed for electric vehicle batteries and for storing wind and solar energy. But as NPR's Kirk Siegler reports, getting a major cobalt industry up and running in the U.S. is still a long shot. Today's opening of the Idaho cobalt mine comes as the Biden administration is trying to fast-track domestic development of strategic minerals needed for an energy transition. But getting away from dirty, combustible engines and moving toward more green power still requires mining. So I'm Bryce Crocker, chief executive officer of Jervois Global. Jervois Global is the Australian-based company opening the cobalt mine in the remote mountains of Idaho not far from the famous Salmon River. Unlike the past mine, which polluted local trout streams, CEO Bryce Crocker says environmental safeguards are in place, including $40 million in guaranteed cleanup funds if something goes south. This mine is also mostly underground, not the old massive open pit. I think this is a really important development for the U.S. Important geopolitically, he means. Most of the cobalt mined in the world currently comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where there are widespread child labor and other human rights problems. Idaho is the only cobalt mine in the United States and is going to remain so. So we viewed it as a strategically important asset for the country, and then all - by default, Jervois, for us to be trusted with stewardship of it, to bring it in production. The Idaho mine will at least initially be a blip in the global market, barely projected to meet 10% of current demand in the U.S. It'll be a while before we could actually say that this is going to be a growth industry. Brad Martin is director of supply chain security at the RAND Corporation. If the ultimate product is batteries, batteries are all pretty much made in China or Korea. So, you know, there may be - you know, this is a step and maybe a useful step, but it's certainly not the be-all, end-all. And the cobalt from this mine will all be shipped to a refinery in Sao Paulo, Brazil, to be processed. That's because current projections show only an initial seven-year run here, making building a U.S. refinery too costly for now. But company officials say they're eyeing new federal funds that might help extend the mine's life cycle. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Boise.(, ""CONCRETE (FEAT. )"") ",Environment

Kimberly Paynter/WHYY hide caption, Across North America, hundreds of downtowns, college campuses and hospitals are heated by steam carried through networks of underground pipes. Electric companies installed many of these ""steam loops"" or district energy systems more than 100 years ago in older East Coast cities like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia., Today, these systems, which often provide chilled water for cooling as well, are experiencing a renaissance as a potential solution to climate change., In Philadelphia, the steam gets generated at a red brick plant built in 1915, one of the few remaining industrial sites that sits along the Schuylkill River. Steam travels through 41 miles of pipe to dozens of buildings, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the University of Pennsylvania and the newly built Comcast Towers., ""It's like a ring of steam where you have a bunch of people connected to that ring taking the steam and using it,"" said Mike Ancona, operations manager for Vicinity Energy, which owns and operates Philadelphia's steam loop system., The plant is a study in contrasts, and illustrates the evolution of electric generation. Ancona points to the high-arched ceilings that are lined with tiles, and the building's detailed brickwork, depicting an era when electricity had begun to replace gas lighting in earnest. It now houses modern boilers alongside a highly efficient cogeneration facility that feeds electricity to the grid, while at the same time, uses excess heat to produce the steam that heats Philadelphia buildings. It also produces food grade steam that is used to sterilize equipment at nearby hospitals, and cook cold cuts., Inside Vicinity Energy's steam generation plant in Grays Ferry. Forty-one miles of pipes beneath Philadelphia's streets carry steam to dozens of office buildings, several hospitals, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Kimberly Paynter/WHYY hide caption, ""So, when this place was built, like 100 years ago, these boilers ran on coal,"" Ancona said. ""If we can go back in time, there would have been a 60,000-ton coal pile sitting here."", The plant originally burned coal that arrived on river barges. It switched to burning oil during World War II. Today it burns natural gas and some waste grease from nearby restaurants to produce the electricity, and uses the waste heat to generate the steam. Most people only see this underground network through the residual steam that rises through sidewalk grates., Vicinity Energy says this highly efficient and flexible system could easily ditch natural gas and replace it with renewable energy or lower carbon fuel to generate that steam., In fact the company has begun to do that with the steam loop system it owns in Boston., ""And the building owners don't have to do a thing,"" said Vicinity Energy CEO Bill DiCroce. ""No major retrofits. No big capital expense on their part. No disruption in the operation of the building. So we become the easy way to decarbonize huge swaths of building space in urban cores."", And it's not just cities that can benefit. Dozens of colleges have district energy systems in place where the fuel source is getting switched in order to lower a university's carbon footprint., ""Instead of doing 150 individual buildings, if you can decarbonize the primary supply to a central plant, then you really achieve lower carbon operations at scale,"" said Rob Thornton, president and CEO of the International District Energy Association., More than 900 of these systems exist in the U.S. and Canada, while there are thousands more worldwide. Thornton says switching those systems from fossil fuel to cleaner energy is a more cost-effective way to achieve electrification without overloading the grid., ""District energy is actually a very elegant solution, particularly for cities, campuses, communities, and clusters of buildings,"" Thornton said. ""It enables buildings to get to net zero."", Vicinity Energy's plant in the Grays Ferry section of South Philadelphia includes a building built in 1915, alongside a modern co-generation plant. Originally coal was used to generate steam, but today, waste heat from a natural gas burning power plant is used. Vicinity says renewables could generate steam in the future. Kimberly Paynter/WHYY hide caption, But in Philadelphia, where city officials pledged to reach net zero by 2050, two federal agencies plan to switch from Vicinity Energy's district steam system to natural gas boilers. This despite President Biden's commitment to tackling climate change, and his executive order mandating federal agencies work to limit emissions., Both Amtrak's 30th Street Station and Independence National Historical Park operated by the National Park Service, which includes the historic Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell Center, have inked deals with the city-owned Philadelphia Gas Works to remove the steam systems and install new natural gas infrastructure., This angers environmental groups that support the steam loop system because of how easy it would be to use it to cut the city's overall carbon emissions., ""The Federal Government has pledged [about] $14 million dollars to install these natural gas boilers that can only burn natural gas for heat,"" said Joseph Ingrao, an attorney who worked with the Clean Air Council until recently., The group is especially frustrated by the fact that, in the case of Amtrak and the National Park Service, there were no attempts to look at the impact on greenhouse gas emissions, no public hearings or comment opportunities, and no public bidding processes., A spokesperson for Amtrak said switching from district steam to natural gas boilers would be both more efficient and save the transportation system money., ""Diversifying the sources offers more reliable heating for the building and provides significant energy cost efficiencies to Amtrak over the contract term,"" wrote Amtrak spokesperson Olivia Irvin in an email. ""Amtrak shares the administration's commitment to a lower carbon future and we will be working to integrate carbon assessments into our projects. "", Amtrak would give no further details on the contract, or any environmental assessment it may have done for the gas boilers it's installing., The National Park Service says plans to convert to natural gas began in 2015, under the Obama Administration, and the move is in line with President Biden's executive order. NPS says the newly installed system will consume less fuel and cost less, but that could not be independently verified., ""The energy required to generate high-pressure steam and transport it 2.5 miles to the park is substantially higher than the park will use to self-generate heating hot water and pump it through closed loop systems serving multiple buildings,"" wrote a spokesperson in an email. ""The future park system, because it will not consume the amount of fuel needed to convert water to steam and will recirculate the heating medium, will use much less fuel than that required to supply steam from the existing provider."", Vicinity COO Kevin Hagerty says the Park Service is ""either disingenuous or uninformed."", ""How can any party claim that a process that will burn additional natural gas will save carbon emissions over a process that captures waste heat that powers 70% of the steam that heats Philadelphia [buildings],"" said Hagerty., DiCroce says that while natural gas may be cheaper, the environment should be taken into consideration., ""People solve for two greens; they solve for the dollars and carbon,"" DiCroce said. ""Different institutions, different people decide which green to lean towards. So those who decide to lean toward the cheapest alternative will make different decisions than those who are trying to look forward to a less carbon-intensive future."", Supporters say district energy has also proven resilient in the face of extreme weather. After Superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast in 2012, the district energy heating and cooling systems remained online despite power failures. And when a deadly winter storm hit Texas last year, crashing the state's power grid, district steam systems that served downtown Houston, the Texas Medical Center's seven hospitals, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas in Austin continued to operate with no service interruptions.",Climate

While the banks have a ""strong record"" of financing projects that create benefits in individual countries, investors need more options to address problems that cut across national borders, Yellen said., ""In the past, most anti-poverty strategies have been country-focused. But today, some of the most powerful threats to the world's poorest and most vulnerable require a different approach,"" Yellen said in prepared remarks at the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C., Climate change is a ""prime example of such a challenge,"" she said, adding, ""No country can tackle it alone."", Yellen delivered her remarks a week before the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank Group in Washington., World Bank President David Malpass was recently criticized by climate activists for refusing to say whether he accepts the prevailing science that burning fossil fuels causes climate change., At the meetings, Yellen said she will call on the World Bank to work with shareholder countries to create an ""evolution roadmap"" to deal with global challenges. Shareholders would then need to push reforms at other development banks, she said, many of which are regional., A World Bank spokesperson said the organization welcomes Yellen's ""leadership on the evolution of [international financial institutions] as developing countries face a severe shortage of resources, the risk of a world recession, capital outflows, and heavy debt service burdens."", The World Bank has said financing for climate action accounted for just over a third of all of its financing activities in the fiscal year that ended June 30., ""In the past, most anti-poverty strategies have been country-focused. But today, some of the most powerful threats to the world's poorest and most vulnerable require a different approach,"" Yellen said at the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C. /AFP via Getty Images hide caption, ""In the past, most anti-poverty strategies have been country-focused. But today, some of the most powerful threats to the world's poorest and most vulnerable require a different approach,"" Yellen said at the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C., Among other potential reforms, Yellen said development banks should rethink how they incentivize investments. That could include using more financing like grants, rather than loans, to help countries cut their reliance on coal-fired power plants, she said., Yellen also said cross-border challenges like climate change require ""quality financing"" from advanced economies that doesn't create unsustainable debts or fuel corruption, as well as investment and technology from the private sector., As part of U.S. efforts, Yellen said the Treasury Department will contribute nearly $1 billion to the Clean Technology Fund, which is managed by the World Bank to help pay for low-carbon technologies in developing countries., ""The world must mitigate climate change and the resultant consequences of forced migration, regional conflicts and supply disruptions,"" Yellen said., Despite those risks, developed countries have failed to meet a commitment they made to provide $100 billion in climate financing annually to developing countries. The issue is expected to be a focus of negotiations at the United Nations climate change conference (COP27) in Egypt in November., The shortfall in climate investing is linked to ""systemic problems"" in global financial institutions, said Carlos Lopes, a professor at the Mandela School of Public Governance at the University of Cape Town., ""We have seen that international financial institutions, for instance, don't have the tools and the instruments to act according to the level of the [climate] challenge,"" Lopes said Thursday during a webinar hosted by the World Resources Institute.",Climate

Deputy Mayor Mike Gibson took to Facebook Live this week to share a video of the destruction at Bonita Beach. Behind him, you can see mountains of debris, destroyed buildings, fallen palm trees, a boat strewn over the sand. And as you can see behind me, this area was hit very hard by Hurricane Ian. First responders have been in the area conducting search and rescue. This is a tough time for our community. Please stay safe. And together, we will get through this. Well, Deputy Mayor Gibson is on the line with me now from Bonita Springs. Welcome. Hi, Mary Louise. Hi. Glad to have you with us. We just heard you describing the scene at the beach. Tell me about other parts of the city. And I know you've been out and about. How bad is the damage? Well, the storm surge came up and, you know, hit the beach first. But we also have a river that goes right through the center of town. So the surge just came right up the river and flooded many houses along the river and a couple creeks that feed into the river. So as you go around the city right now, you just see basically everybody's entire life out at the street because they've had to gut their entire house. All their belongings are out there, just trash, you know, waiting to be picked up. It's horrible to see. Yeah. Do y'all have power back? Do you have water? Sounds like too much water. But, I mean, do you have water in the pipes? Yeah. Yeah. Luckily, our local utility company, they were able to keep water for the majority of the city. They preemptively turned off water to the barrier islands just to save the rest of the city. So we never had a boil water notice or anything. Power, very, very few places had power the entire time. Most places lost power. But it's on almost everywhere, except for places where, like, trees took down the individual line going to a house, where, like, telephone poles got snapped. Things like that take a little bit longer to fix. But we're we're almost up to, I'd say, probably 90% power. I'm thinking you must have residents who evacuated who are now heading back to their homes or trying to figure out how to head back to their homes, which may have been damaged or even destroyed. What are you hearing from them? And do you have any advice to prepare them for what they might see when they get home? I mean, it really depends on where they live. The bulk of the city, it's going to just look like a bad storm - tree limbs down, things like that, a lot of debris. It's really the people that are coming down where their houses are, right on the river or out on the barrier islands. Right now, out on the barrier islands, we're only allowing people to walk to their houses to help with looting and other things. But it should be starting Saturday. They'll be able to drive out there. We've been working with the county to get the road reinforced because when the storm surge came in, it washed away a lot of the dirt under the road. Parts of the road started collapsing. Right, right, right. So you're worried about sinkholes and about road accidents on top of everything else. Correct. Yeah. Just in the few seconds we have left, the president, President Biden, was in Florida yesterday. He was announcing more aid. He said the federal government will cover 100% of costs for things like removing all that debris. Do you expect to see any of that money soon in Bonita Springs? It's a process. And traditionally, it's only 30 days. Thankfully, the president's already upped it to 60. And our congressman, Congressman Byron Donalds, is working on a plan to get that up to 120 days. So I really hope that the president will, you know, stand with our congressman and try to get that done up to 120 the days, because we just had, you know, the hurricane five years ago. And, you know, it takes a while to get everything and submitted. So the extra time would be great. Bonita Springs Deputy Mayor Mike Gibson, thank you so much for your time. Good luck. You're welcome. Thank you. ",National

Southern California, specifically, is offering to use 9% less water a year, which could really help out neighboring states. But California wants something in return, too. Alex Hager reports on the Colorado River for member station KUNC and is here to explain. Hi, Alex. Howdy. Thanks for having me. Thanks for being here. So this summer, the federal government told the states that share the Colorado River that they needed to write plans to take significantly less water due to the decade-long drought. California has now been the first to respond. How do they plan to meet this goal? Yeah, Southern California is proposing to cut back by about 9%. And they're still sorting out the details of who exactly will give up how much water, but this is a deal that's bringing together suppliers for farms and cities alike. So the four agencies involved kind of have the ability to spread out the impact of those cuts. And this announcement comes amid mounting pressure for them to use less. The federal government asked the states that share the river to conserve. And, you know, a lot of those states responded by pointing fingers at California, which uses by far the most water from the river. So now this is California's response. They're coming out with the first major water conservation deal since the feds asked for cuts. OK. But what are they asking for in return? The California group is asking for federal money to help with the Salton Sea. It's this big, salty lake that gets filled with irrigation runoff from nearby farms. But when there's less water heading to California, that lake dries up. And then all the salt and dust that's left behind - it's causing an ecological and health crisis for the area. OK. And their request - how is that landing with the feds? It's hard to say right now. You know, this was just announced yesterday. But we do know that the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which runs the big dams on the Colorado River - they're getting $4 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act, and I've got sources telling me that the bulk of that will go to projects in the Colorado River Basin. So these California agencies could be trying to get a slice of that funding to help with Salton Sea issues in exchange for their plans to conserve water. Thinking big-picture here, you know, drought is ongoing. Reservoir levels keep dropping. And yet, 40 million people still depend on water from this river. Is all of that giving a new sense of urgency to these negotiations? Absolutely. This river is supplying people from Wyoming to Mexico, and right now it is just really on the ropes. There is a lot of demand. And every year for the past 23 years, there has been less water to go around. The situation is dire, and that's coming across in this deal. There's a lot of tension between cities and agriculture, so it's not every day you get them to sit down together and agree on something. Deven Upadhyay is the assistant GM for the Metropolitan Water District. They serve about 19 million people across Southern California. The nature and severity of the condition that we're facing right now on the river really has caused, I think, everybody in the states, but in particular in California - all of us - to try to band together as agencies and figure out how we can contribute and be part of a solution. All right, Alex, so in the time we have left, what is next for the rest of the states that use water from the Colorado River? Well, we haven't seen any other tangible plans for new conservation, you know, elsewhere along the river. When the federal government started putting on the pressure, they threatened mandatory cutbacks. But states called their bluff and said they didn't think the feds had the legal authority to do that. So far, the federal government has not followed through, so it is still up to the states to come up with conservation plans. There's a chance this California deal will help get the ball rolling for more states to do something similar. And when I talked to the designers of the plan, they said that was their hope. That was KUNC's Alex Hager. Alex, thank you. Thank you for having me.(, ""DEDICATION"") ",National

Kerem Yucel/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, An aerial view of icebergs and the ice sheet near Pituffik, Greenland., During Earth's ice ages, much of North America and northern Europe were covered in massive glaciers., About 20,000 years ago, those ice sheets began to melt rapidly, and the resulting water had to go somewhere — often, underneath the glaciers. Over time, massive valleys formed underneath the ice to drain the water away from the ice., A new study about how glaciers melted after the last ice age could help researchers better understand how today's ice sheets might respond to extreme warmth as a result of climate change, the study's authors say., The study, published this week in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, helped clarify how — and how quickly — those channels were formed., ""Our results show, for the first time, that the most important mechanism is probably summer melting at the ice surface that makes its way to the bed through cracks or chimneys-like conduits and then flows under the pressure of the ice sheet to cut the channels,"" said Kelly Hogan, a co-author and geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey., By analyzing 3D seismic reflection data originally collected through hazard assessments for oil and gas companies, researchers found thousands of valleys across the North Sea. Those valleys, some of them millions of years old, are now buried deep underneath the mud of the seafloor., Some of the channels were massive — as big as 90 miles across and three miles wide (""several times larger than Loch Ness,"" the U.K.-based research group noted)., A digital model of a massive channel that carried meltwater away from ancient glaciers. James Kirkham/British Antarctic Survey hide caption, A digital model of a massive channel that carried meltwater away from ancient glaciers., What surprised the researchers the most, they said, was how quickly those valleys formed. When ice melted rapidly, the water carved out the valleys in hundreds of years — lightning speed, in geologic terms., ""This is an exciting discovery,"" said lead author James Kirkham, a researcher with BAS and the University of Cambridge. ""We know that these spectacular valleys are carved out during the death throes of ice sheets. By using a combination of state-of-the-art subsurface imaging techniques and a computer model, we have learnt that tunnel valleys can be eroded rapidly beneath ice sheets experiencing extreme warmth,"", The meltwater channels are traditionally thought to stabilize glacial melt, and by extension sea level rise, by helping to buffer the collapse of the ice sheets, researchers said., The new findings could complicate that picture. But the fast rate at which the channels formed means including them in present-day models could help improve the accuracy of predictions about current ice sheet melt, the authors added., Today, only two major ice sheets remain: Greenland and Antarctica. The rate at which they melt is likely to increase as the climate warms., ""The crucial question now is will this 'extra' meltwater flow in channels cause our ice sheets to flow more quickly, or more slowly, into the sea,"" Hogan said.",Climate

Brian Inganga/AP hide caption, Farmers near Nairobi offload livestock manure that will be used to fertilize crops. Because of the war in Ukraine, where a lot of fertilizer is produced, the price of it has skyrocketed, and Kenyan farmers say they now cannot afford to buy it., Benard Mwenja is one of the luckier farmers in Kenya. He's still able to grow and harvest crops – something he's been doing for three decades to earn his livelihood in a country where agriculture is the backbone of the economy., The majority of farmers in Kenya are smallholders, and they rely on their crops not only for income but as a source of food for their families. But it's become harder than ever to make a living, said Mwenja, who is 69., One problem is the erratic rainfall due to the changing climate. Mwenja has reserve supplies of water saved up in reservoirs to draw upon when the rains falter., ""It took me a long time to dig up the earthen water pans on my farm,"" says Mwenja, referring to the pond-like craters dug in various parts of his farm to collect rainwater. ""It was a lot of work because I was digging by hand."", He uses a mix of drip and sprinkler irrigation systems to water his crops. The water mainly flows with the help of gravity, although in some instances he needs to use a water pump, which he says has been expensive to purchase and maintain. ""My neighbors were doubtful if all that work would pay off,"" he says., But it has. His neighbor's corn plants – a staple crop – are wilted, their bean plants are drying up., ""They have asked us to cut their maize stalks and give to our cows, because they will not be able to harvest anything,"" he says. ""They can now see that the reservoirs have become very useful."", Benard Mwenja's reserve water supply has helped him weather the drought better than many of his neighbors. He is now focusing on more stable crops like kale, carrots and onions instead of relying only on corn with its fluctuating prices. Michael Kaloki for NPR hide caption, Benard Mwenja's reserve water supply has helped him weather the drought better than many of his neighbors. He is now focusing on more stable crops like kale, carrots and onions instead of relying only on corn with its fluctuating prices., And it's not just the lack of rain that's making life tough for Kenya's 10 million farmers, who represent about a fifth of the population. It seems as if everything is conspiring against them. The rising cost of fuel, the lack of fertilizer and even the war in Ukraine all pose new obstacles., ""We have been planting cereals for many years, but it is now becoming difficult to plant cereals because of the prices,"" Mwenja says with a frown on his face. Small-scale corn famers across the country have called on both the government and private millers to increase the purchase price of corn to be more in line with the rising cost of living. Because of corn's fluctuating price, Mwenja seems to have more faith in his other crops, such as kale, carrots and onions. His kale's big leaves now look lush and green, ready for picking., But he is concerned about the effect of erratic weather on his farm. ""In this area, because of the weather change, people are not even planting vegetables. We are doing the vegetables because I have water reservoirs,"" he says., Many of Mwenja's neighbors have suffered the effects of poor rainfall. Countries in the Horn of Africa are experiencing their worst drought in 40 years, fueling a hunger crisis. According to a report by the international aid agency Oxfam, over 21 million people across Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia face acute hunger. The report also forecasts that recurrent droughts will continue to aggravate the region's fragility, causing further crop failures, food instability, losses of livelihoods and large-scale internal displacement., The government is promising help. On Sept. 13, Dr. William Ruto, Kenya's newly elected president, pledged to tackle climate change in his inaugural speech. Ruto acknowledged that citizens of Kenya were suffering ""the consequences of climate emergency,"" and suggested he would encourage the use of renewable energy in place of fossil fuels. ""Kenya is on transition to clean energy that will support jobs, local economies and sustainable industrialization,"" he said., That is not the only issue that farmers hope Ruto addresses. Fuel prices in the country recently shot up after the president decided to partially scrap some of the fuel subsidies the government had earlier put in place. In his speech, Ruto raised concerns that the subsidies had become too costly and prone to abuse., ""This will definitely have an effect on us here on the farms,"" Mwenja says. ""It will become more expensive to hire a tractor to come and till the land."", And many farmers use public transportation – such as buses or ""boda bodas"" (motorcycle taxis) — to go into town to pick up fertilizer. ""It will be more expensive for me to bring it home, because public transport is likely to go up as a result of the fuel subsidy being removed,"" says Mwenja., On top of rising fuel prices, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has also made obtaining crucial fertilizer even harder, leading Mwenja to question just how sustainable farming will be. A significant proportion of Kenya's fertilizer comes from that region, such as di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), the world's most widely used phosphorus fertilizer for crop nutrition. Because of the war, a disruption in the supply chain has caused the price of fertilizer to shoot up by as much as 30%, leading to an outcry from farmers across the Kenya., ""The war in Ukraine has had a really big affect on us farmers,"" Mwenja says, looking across his land. ""All around me here, my neighbors planted without using fertilizer, because they could not afford it. Their crop has failed this time around."" And while Mwenja was fortunate enough to be able to buy fertilizer, all of these rising expenses has forced him to go without some things he would usually have bought for his family., ""Nowadays we have had to adjust our diet and cut back on buying things like meat,"" Mwenja says. ""I was also building a better farmhouse, but now I have had to stop, because I cannot afford to continue at the moment."", Mwenja also has a large number of extended family members who rely on him financially. ""There are 20 people who depend on me, "" he says., In mid-September, a few days after Ruto's inauguration, the National Treasury of Kenya released the equivalent of $29 million U.S. dollars for a program to provide subsidized fertilizer to farmers in order to help cushion them from rising prices. ""We are thankful to the government,"" says Mwenja, ""but we are not sure how long they will be able to sustain the subsidy."", Abraham Muthogo, a Nairobi-based economist, described the move by the government as ""a good thing for now."" But, he says, ""Subsidies are a short-term measure. It is the proverbial 'stopping the patient bleeding.'"", Muthogo hopes the government can find longer-term solutions, such as ""providing incentives to local entrepreneurs or encouraging international fertilizer producers to come and set up plants here in the country."" He says local production would greatly reduce costs and shield farmers from situations like the war in Ukraine., ""I am hopeful for a bright future,"" says Mwenja. ""If the government is able to sustain the subsidized fertilizer program, it will help us farmers get back on our feet. If we work hand in hand with the government, we can help mitigate the effects of climate change and hopefully ensure we have enough water for our crops."", Michael Kaloki lives in Nairobi, Kenya.

Susan Phillips of member station WHYY in Philadelphia reports these steam lube systems could be a climate change solution. The steam that travels through 41 miles of pipe below Philadelphia's streets is generated at a red brick building built in 1915. Officially known as district energy systems, most of us notice this underground network only when residual steam escapes from the sidewalk grates. It's like a ring of steam where you have a bunch of people who are connected to that ring or are taking their steam and they're using it. Mike Ancona is the operations manager with Vicinity Energy, which owns and operates Philadelphia's steam loop system. The plant illustrates the evolution of electric generation. High-arched ceilings are lined with tiles, and detailed brickwork points to an era when electricity had begun to replace guest lighting in earnest. When this place was built, like, a hundred years ago - right? - these boilers ran on coal. There would have been a 60,000-ton coal pile sitting here. The days of coal-generated steam are long gone. During World War II, the plant switched to oil. Today, modern natural gas boilers generate electricity sold to the grid. The waste heat makes the steam. Ancona says this highly efficient and flexible system could easily ditch natural gas and replace it with renewable energy or lower carbon fuel to generate that steam. In fact, Vicinity Energy has begun to do that with the steam loop system it owns in Boston, says CEO Bill DiCroce. And the building owners don't have to do a thing; so no major retrofits, no big capital expense on their part, no disruption. We become the easy way to decarbonize huge swaths of building space in urban cores. And it's not just cities that can benefit. Dozens of colleges have district energy systems in place where the fuel source is getting switched in order to lower a university's carbon footprint. But in Philadelphia, two federal agencies plan to switch from Vicinity Energy's district steam system to natural gas boilers; this despite President Biden's commitment to tackling climate change and his executive order mandating federal agencies work to limit emissions. These include Amtrak's big train station and buildings operated by the National Park Service, like the historic Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell Center. This angers environmental groups that support the steam loop system because of how easy it would be to use it to cut the city's overall carbon emissions. Joseph Ingrao is an attorney who worked with the Clean Air Council. The federal government has pledged over $14 million to installing these natural gas boilers that can only burn natural gas for heat. An Amtrak spokesperson says the new gas boilers will be cheaper and more reliable. The National Park Service says switching to natural gas will cut its carbon emissions. But that could not be independently verified. Vicinity's DiCroce says the environment should be taken into consideration. Those who decide to lean towards the cheapest alternative will make different decisions with those who are trying to look forward to a less carbon-intensive future. And they'll be willing to pay a little bit more for the advantage of being better for the planet. Supporters of district energy systems say it's not just a lower carbon climate solution. They also are more resilient in the face of extreme weather. After Superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast in 2012, district energy systems remained online.For NPR News, I'm Susan Phillips in Philadelphia. ",National

It's a point he reiterated while speaking in Puerto Rico, listing off the hurdles Puerto Ricans have faced in recent years, from previous hurricanes and COVID-19 to earthquakes., ""Puerto Rico is a strong place, and Puerto Ricans are strong people, but even so, you have had to bear so much, and more than need be. And you haven't gotten the help in a timely way."", Hurricane Fiona hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 18 as a Category 1 storm, delivering over 30 inches of rain, which engulfed entire communities, destroyed roads and critical infrastructure and killed at least 13 people., As of last Wednesday, there were over 1,000 federal response workers on the ground in Puerto Rico — including more than 100 search and rescue personnel — to help the island recover from the hurricane.

John Wessels/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, Rising seas have displaced hundreds of people from Guet NDar fishing village in Senegal to relocation camps., As a climate change expert at the World Bank, Arame Tall is deeply familiar with the facts and figures of global warming. She understands how rising seas and changing weather cycles are affecting her home country of Senegal — from a retreating coastline in the city of Dakar where she grew up, to her mother's hometown of Diourbel, where drought and floods have forced people to abandon their peanut farms., But even with all that knowledge, Tall was still shocked when her own nephew attempted to flee the country for a better life in Europe. ""To the whole family's astonishment, he disappeared one night, and we looked for him,"" she told me. ""He couldn't be found."", Earlier this year, 18-year-old Amadou had reached the boat that was supposed to smuggle him out of Senegal and into Spain. The captain warned of heavy rain that was forecast at sea and said the trip might not be safe. Afraid for his life, Amadou disembarked., ""Everybody else who got on that boat never came back,"" Tall told me. ""And they were confirmed to have sunk in the Atlantic. So he escaped. But you always wonder, what if he had actually taken that boat?"", There is an expression in Wolof, one of Senegal's main languages: Djawou bou soppekou. It literally means, ""The weather is changing."", Today, we are launching a project to look at how the ripples of climate change are radiating outward. Beginning in Senegal, my team and I are setting out to connect the dots on three major stories that I have often covered as distinct issues over the years., Follow our live travel blog for the trip from Africa to Europe, My most ambitious reporting trips as a host of All Things Considered have tended to return to a few consistent themes., A woman looks at the damage outside her house, caused during a high tide period in Bargny, Senegal. John Wessels/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, A woman looks at the damage outside her house, caused during a high tide period in Bargny, Senegal., Lately, I've started wondering about the ways in which these three broad themes weave together. What is the connection between climate change, the movement of people around the globe, and the rise of xenophobic politicians? That's the overarching question we're hoping to answer with this reporting trip., The links among these three global trend lines are not hard to find. Many right-wing political leaders make attacks on migrants an overt part of their pitch. Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign with the racist claim that Mexico was sending rapists to the United States, and one of his most frequent applause lines as president was that he would build a wall along the southern U.S. border. In Sweden, members of an anti-immigrant political party that I reported on when they were outsiders in 2015 now have a shot at controlling the government. And in Italy, voters just chose a prime minister who has called for a naval blockade of Africans., We also know that climate change is speeding up the movement of people around the world. Exactly how fast is difficult to specify., ""When we say 'climate migrant,' we don't really know what we're saying,"" Jay Balagna of the RAND Corporation told me. ""There's such a wide range of definitions."", If you define climate migrants only as people whose homes are swallowed by rising seas, the number might be a few million by the middle of this century. On the other hand, U.N. experts have argued that climate change exacerbated the conditions that led to the civil war in Syria. So under more sweeping definitions, the number of ""climate migrants"" around the world could quickly climb much higher. And of course, we don't know how aggressively the world will move to limit carbon emissions and avert the worst possible impacts of climate change., A palm field suffers from desertification near Morocco's southeastern oasis town of Erfoud. Fadel Senna/AFP via Getty Images hide caption, A palm field suffers from desertification near Morocco's southeastern oasis town of Erfoud., To complicate matters further, there is rarely only one reason someone decides to leave their home country for a more promising life elsewhere., ""So is it one plus one equals two? No, not necessarily,"" Tall says. ""But in our lived experience in African countries, we've seen a dramatic shift in the number of climate related disasters that have been hitting us across the continent."", As Kayly Ober of Refugees International told me, climate change can be a ""vulnerability multiplier,"" exacerbating other factors (such as corruption and poverty) that were already making life difficult to sustain., But where human rights advocates see climate change as a vulnerability multiplier, opponents of migration see a threat multiplier. Some far-right extremists have used worst-case-scenario forecasts of climate migration as excuses to attack immigrants., In El Paso, Texas, a mass shooter in 2019 killed more than 20 people and wounded more than 20 others. He told authorities he was targeting Mexicans, and he left behind a manifesto that read in part: ""The decimation of the environment is creating a massive burden for future generations ... If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can be more sustainable."", This areal view shows rows of boats used for harvesting salt in Lake Retba in Senegal in 2021. Marco Longari /AFP via Getty Images hide caption, This areal view shows rows of boats used for harvesting salt in Lake Retba in Senegal in 2021., Most climate displacement tends to be within a country, or at least a region. People will rarely abandon their homeland unless they see no other option. But in every hemisphere, there is also cross-border movement. Bangladeshis leave flooded coastal communities to become guest workers in the Middle East; El Salvadorans whose farms have stopped producing food make their way through Mexico to find jobs in the United States; and people from the Sahel region of Africa flee the encroaching desert, traveling north to pursue a better life in Europe., That last route is the one that we will be following over the next three weeks. Our itinerary will take us to three countries, following a path that countless migrants have taken before us: from Senegal, through Morocco, to Spain., , Our stories from the trip will be broadcast on the radio and published on NPR.org during this year's U.N. climate summit, which is taking place in Egypt in November., We also want to take you with us as we experience this journey, giving you opportunities to follow our travels in real time. So, we have launched a live travel blog that offers daily behind-the-scenes updates from our whole team., The last time I flew to Senegal was aboard Air Force One. I was a White House correspondent covering Barack Obama's trip to Africa in 2013. I accompanied the president as he visited Goree Island, a port where boatloads of people captured and condemned to slavery were shipped to the West. It was the last place many touched African soil., After gazing out the door of no return, Obama reflected on what he took away from that view, telling reporters, ""We have to remain vigilant when it comes to the defense of people's human rights. Because I'm a firm believer that humanity is fundamentally good. But it's only good when good people stand up for what's right."", This project is focused on a different kind of mass exodus, though it too raises questions about human rights and the goodness of humanity. When I spoke with Tall about her research into climate change and her own family's experiences in Senegal, she used an expression that I had never heard before. As she described the extreme weather events forcing people to relocate, she said, ""No one will sit on a sinking ship."" The phrase struck me, and I asked her if this was a well-known Senegalese expression. She seemed surprised by my question. It's a concept that is simply obvious where she grew up, she said. ""It's common sense where I come from.""",Environment

And that's because we expect to see an increase in destructive storms in the coming years, which means we will likely have some tough decisions to face about where development can take place in the future. Should people be living in areas known to be in the path of storms that are likely to get worse? And this invites even thornier questions of how, where and, yes, whether to rebuild in some areas.It's a painful question in the aftermath of a tremendous personal and community tragedy like Hurricane Ian. But eventually, it may come down to this - which communities will be deemed worth saving and which ones won't. Our next guest, Steven Bingler, has been dealing with these issues for more than 15 years. Bingler is an architect and the founder and CEO of Concordia. That's a design firm in New Orleans. In 2006, Bingler's firm helped lead the recovery plan for Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, and he's with us now. Mr. Bingler, thanks so much for joining us. Thank you. I'm happy to be here. So one solution that you recommended for south Louisiana and other flood-prone areas is something called managed retreat. What is that? What does that mean? Well, managed retreat is what happens after you can't mitigate anymore. And the first line of defense, of course, is building levees and doing other, you know, stormwater management and other mechanisms to make the place where you are more safe to live. Once you've exhausted those mechanisms, then pretty much the only option left is to move to higher ground. It's my understanding that there's no large-scale cross-state or federal initiative for managed retreat. So I was just wondering, you know, why is it there doesn't seem to be any larger federal initiative in this area. Well, I'm not so sure that we, as a larger community, as a national community, have fully addressed or prepared to fully address the kinds of changes that we're going to be facing and the kind of planning that it's going to take for us to address these changes. And a lot of times, people talk about storms, hurricanes, and - but then we have to be reminded of just a couple of months ago, Kentucky was experiencing riverine flooding. And then we have wildfires in the West, and then we have drought, actually. I think that we are of a mindset that if we just look at these things individually, then maybe we can solve them individually. But they're all connected to this larger conversation or this larger event, which has to do with changing climates. And everybody is pretty much going to be impacted. Nobody is going to be left out. But that invites the other question, which is - I think which leads people to wonder, why are cities and communities still developing areas that face heightened risks of experiencing climate disasters in the near future? Well, I think the reason is because real estate developers are trying to sell real estate and trying to build homes, and I'm not sure that the public is aware of what they're moving into. And of course, the other question also speaks to communities that have been long developed, that have been there for a long time, in some cases, you know, for generations or maybe hundreds of years. And after Katrina, there was discussion around ceasing development in the Ninth Ward. This is a predominantly Black neighborhood. It was one of the hardest-hit parts of the city. Talk to me a little bit about that. I mean, on the one hand, a lot of people would say, well, that's reasonable, isn't it, that this was an area that was devastated? And so... Yes. And... ...It's reasonable to have that conversation. So talk to me a little bit more about that. People want to be in the place where their families are. They want to be in a place, you know, where they grew up. And that's a cultural thing, and that's a social thing. So we can't just do physical planning. We also have to realize that we have to be understanding the social and psychological consequences of people uprooting their whole lives. So what are some of the questions that you would hope that leaders and citizens would be asking themselves as they figure out what to do next, based on your experience? Right. Well, I mean, the first thing I think that we all need to ask ourselves is, are we prepared yet? Are we really prepared to plan ahead for this, for these conditions? Politically, it's not an easy thing for a mayor of a community to break the news to the people in that community that, you know, we're all going to have to move to higher ground. I don't think that we've addressed yet the magnitude of the cost.Our current thinking about budget deficits is just minor compared to the cost of rebuilding these communities. In New Orleans, it was $186 billion, and Houston was - it was somewhere around $130 billion. And who knows what Fort Myers is going to be. But when you start adding those numbers up over time, you start - and then you add in drought. You add in what's it going to take, you know, when Phoenix gets to the point where it's, you know, people can't live there anymore? And how do you have those conversations in ways that don't just replicate the inequities that have - that we've seen all throughout history - right? - where the most vulnerable people get the least desirable of everything? I mean, maybe that sounds like a ridiculous sort of question, but part of the reason that people live in these low-lying areas to begin with is because they had no power, right? And so... Not only is that not a ridiculous question - that's the fundamental question, right? Because the fact of the matter is that the people who are living on the lowest ground are the people who have the least means and the highest needs. The most important lesson that I learned and I think we in New Orleans learned after Hurricane Katrina, is that these changes, these plans cannot be developed by some outside entity. It can't be done by planners. It can't be done by politicians. The planning for the level of change that we're facing has to come from the community, and the community has to be engaged authentically in that process because it's literally life and death. That was Steven Bingler, CEO and founder of Concordia. That's a design firm, a community-based design firm in New Orleans. Steven Bingler, thanks so much for talking with us today and sharing this history with us. Thank you. ",Climate

(AP) — Rescuers evacuated stunned survivors on a large barrier island cut off by Hurricane Ian and Florida's death toll climbed sharply, as hundreds of thousands of people were still sweltering without power days after the monster storm rampaged from the state's southwestern coast up to the Carolinas., Florida, with nearly four dozen reported dead, was hit hardest by the Category 4 hurricane, one of the strongest to make landfall in the United States. Flooded roadways and washed-out bridges to barrier islands left many people isolated, amid limited cellphone service and a lack of basic amenities such as water, electricity and the internet., Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saturday that multibillionaire businessman Elon Musk was providing some 120 Starlink satellites to ""help bridge some of the communication issues."" Starlink, a satellite-based internet system created by Musk's SpaceX, will provide high-speed connectivity., Florida utilities were working to restore power. As of Saturday night, nearly 1 million homes and businesses were still without electricity, down from a peak of 2.67 million., At least 54 people were confirmed dead: 47 in Florida, four in North Carolina and three in Cuba., More than 1,000 people were rescued from flooded areas along Florida's southwestern coast alone, Daniel Hokanson, a four-star general and head of the National Guard, told The Associated Press while airborne to Florida., In Washington, the White House announced that President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden would travel to Florida on Wednesday. But a brief statement did not release any details of the planned visit to the state., The bridge to Pine Island, the largest barrier island off Florida's Gulf Coast, was destroyed by the storm, leaving it accessible only by boat or air. The volunteer group Medic Corps, which responds to natural disasters worldwide with pilots, paramedics and doctors, went door-to-door asking residents if they wanted to be evacuated., Some flew out by helicopter, and people described the horror of being trapped in their homes as water kept rising., ""The water just kept pounding the house and we watched, boats, houses — we watched everything just go flying by,"" Joe Conforti said, fighting back tears. He said if it wasn't for his wife, who suggested they get up on a table to avoid the rising water, he wouldn't have made it: ""I started to lose sensibility, because when the water's at your door and it's splashing on the door and you're seeing how fast it's moving, there's no way you're going to survive that."", River flooding posed a major challenge at times to rescue and supply delivery efforts. The Myakka River washed over a stretch of Interstate 75, forcing a traffic-snarling highway closure for a while before officials said later Saturday that it could be reopened., While swollen rivers have crested or are near cresting, the levels aren't expected to drop significantly for days, National Weather Service meteorologist Tyler Fleming said., Elsewhere, South Carolina's Pawleys Island, a beach community roughly 75 miles (115 kilometers) up the coast from Charleston, was also hit hard. Power remained knocked out to at least half the island Saturday., Eddie Wilder, who has been coming to Pawleys Island for more than six decades, said it was ""insane"" to see waves as high as 25 feet (7.6 meters) wash away a landmark pier near his home., ""We watched it hit the pier and saw the pier disappear,"" he said. ""We watched it crumble and and watched it float by with an American flag."", Wilder's house, located 30 feet (9 meters) above the shoreline, stayed dry inside., Steve Gibson, left background, helps Maria Zoltac into the back of his truck as her sister Susan Zoltac, left, makes herself comfortable with her dogs after being rescued from Florida's Sanibel Island on Saturday.

Charter captain Ryan Kane said his vessel was so badly damaged that he was unable to use it to help rescue people, and now it will be a long time before he can take clients fishing again., ""There's a hole in the hull.
